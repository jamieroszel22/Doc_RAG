Not only does this mean a one-to-many relationship, but the relationship is also reversed: the model is already there before any specific use cases are considered. One result of this is that the use case has become more important as a governed item in its own right, separate from the (foundation) models applied to deliver a use case.

For many enterprise use cases, these are not one-off but repeated interactions that take the form of a parametrized prompt template. For example, for a retrieval-augmented generation use case, an LLM is prompted each time a user query comes in.

Confidentiality and integrity assurance for \ndata at rest  and data in transit  is typically provided \nthrough cryptography. Nevertheless, data in use  is generally unencr ypted while it is \nprocessed by the system, which can make data in use accessible to privileged users or workloads.\nIn the past, data owners relied upon operational assurance to control access to workloads \nand data.

A workload running in a cloud infrastructure owned by  a service provider, \nmaintained by the providerâs administrators, a nd shared with other tenants requires a novel \nand complete approach to protecting data and developing applications in a trusted environment. The data security concerns might even be prohibitive when you consider applications for a hybrid cloud infrastructure, more so if you cannot validate the trust of all parties. There might also be regulatory compliance to adhere to or business-specific needs for higher levels of data security controls that mandate protection at every stage of a digital interaction or data lifecycle. \nThis chapter discusses the threats, concerns, requirements, and the solution for a hybrid \ncloud infrastructure with data security in mind.

To help understand how a \ncyberattack might threaten a system, application, or data, the well-known STRIDE threat \nmodel  can be used. This model conceptualizes the potential threats into six categories:\n1. Spoofing. An entity falsely identifies as another identity\n2. Tampering with data. The malicious modification of data3. Repudiation. An entity disputing its respon sibility, ownership or authorship of data, \nresources or operations\n4. Information disclosure. The exposur",

An attack to get elevated privileges or privileged access to a system \nor resource \nAnother way to look at threats is the path that an attacker might use to gain access to a \nsystem, application, or data, referred to as an attack vector. There are many well-known attack vectors, some of which have been used to successfully attack applications and gain \naccess to sensitive data (reference IBM X-ForceÂ® Threat Intelligence Index 2023 ).

Thus, an attacker cannot access the data at rest even with access to the physical storage device. \nHowever, data in use is generally unencrypted and easily accessible, as it is active data being \nprocessed by the system.

Block storage divides data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of  data wherever it is most efficient. That \nmeans it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured or partitioned to work with different operating systems.\nBlock storage allows for the creation of raw storage volumes to which server-based operating \nsystems can connect. Block storage also decouples data from user environments, allowing that data to be spread across multiple environments. This creates multiple paths to the data and allows the user to retrieve it quickly. When a user or application requests data from a block storage system, ",

The Security  Advisory is a list of vulnerab ilities and security issues that \nare identified and highlighted in a report within Jenkins. The report includes a description of the vulnerability, security risks posed, severities, versions it  affects, workarounds, and any \npossible solutions.\nThe eight key forms of security for Jenkins fall under three categories:\n1. Basic setup:\nâ Controller Isolationâ Access Control\n2. Build Behavior:\nâ Access control for buildsâ Securing buildsâ Handling environment variables\n3. Use",

Build image authors need to understand two key concepts to get the best performance out of S2I - The build process and S2I scripts.\nS2I creates images that are ready-to-run by injecting the source code into a specific container \nthat prepares it for execution.\n\nChapter 4.

Workflows are created that build and test every pull request to the repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.\nGitHub Actions can be configured into a workfl ow to be triggered when an event occurs in a \nrepository, such as a pull request being opened, or an issue being created. The workflow contains one or more jobs, which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job runs inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container.

Encryption keys explained\nKey generation is the process of creating encryption keys that can be used to encrypt and \ndecrypt sensitive data that needs to be protected from unauthorized access. The kind of keys that need to be generated depends on the algorithm used for encryption. Symmetric-key algorithms, such as AES, use a single key for encryption an d decryption. A symmetric- or \nPublic-Key algorithms, such as ECC, use a public-key to encrypt and the corresponding \nprivate-key to decrypt. The keys can be used to generate and verify signatures over data to prove their originality. This is especially useful with asymmetric keys in which the private key \nis used to generate the sign",

The starting point is usually a seed that is used to generate a series of random \nnumbers to increase the statistical randomness of the algorithm used. A seed can be generated in software, but it can be embedded in hardware, which makes it secure and helps Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) generate random numbers. The generated random numbers can be used to generate encryption keys.\nThe same seed, if it is used with the same algorithm, generates the same encryption key. So, \nit is vitally important to protect the seed.\nFor more details on how seeds are used in confidential computing with Hyper Protect Virtual \nServer (HPVS), see IBM Cloud: Securing your data .\nFor further information on random number generation see 4.3.4, âR",

Before an HSM can be deployed, it must be initialized in a secure environment with a master key. Because all other keys generated by the HSM are derived from the Master Key, it is important to ensure that the master key is not compromised by any one individual. Hence, the master key is often divided into master ke",

See Figure D-2.\nFigure D-2   HSM initialization process\nWhat are data encryption keys (DEKs)\nA data encryption key is a type of key that is designed to encrypt and decrypt data. DEKs are \ngenerally provided by the application that owns the data being encrypted. Data is encrypted and decrypted with the help of the same DEK. Hence, a DEK must be stored for at least a specified duration for decrypting the generated cypher text. \n\n\nAppendix D. Encryption keys explained 123There are four levels in a DEK lifecycle:\n1. The key is created using the crypto module of the encryption engine.\n2. The key ",

The key is then suspended, terminated, or destroyed. \nA DEK can be customized to expire during a particular time frame to prevent data from being \ncompromised. Under such circumstances, it should be used once more for decrypting the data and then the resulting clear text is re-keyed, which means it is encrypted by using a new key.\nWhat are key encryption keys (KEKs)\nAs the name suggests, a key encryption key is used with envelope encryption  to protect a \nDEK from unauthorized use. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plain text data with a data key and then encrypting the data key under another key. \nEnvelope encryption reduces the network load for the application or the cloud service as only \nthe request and fulfillmen t of the much smaller data ",

If the seed is generated within a confidential  computing enclave or Trusted Execution \nEnvironment (TEE), encryption keys generated can be used without exposing them to external threats. To achieve the best security, the technologies can be combined.\nWith a Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS) instance connected to an HPVS instance that \nis protected with Secure Execution for Linux,  a simple yet secure signing setup can be \nestablished. This setup can be used to securely generate and use a certificate authority (CA).\nThe whole process can be built into containe rs running within the H PVS instance.

This wrapped key can be used only with the HSM backing the HPCS instance. To use this secure key, the container generates a CA certif icate signing request (CSR). This is then in \nturn signed using an external signer with a well-known root certificate. Alternatively the CSR can be self-signed to produce a new root certificate. The resulting certificate can be used to establish a trusted certificate chain on t he leaf certificates to be generated next.\nIn the next step, the intermediate key pair can be used to sign CSRs by itself. This further \nexpands the certificate chain to leaf certificates to be used for means such as TLS, code signing, and so on. Each of these leaf cert ificate keys can either be generated in the \napplication where it is used or within the secure environment.\n\n124 Applying Data Protection and Confident iali",
