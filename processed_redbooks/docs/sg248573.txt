Â© Copyright IBM Corp. 2025. 1Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in 
AI governance
In 2024, the topic of governance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown enormously in both 
attention and in adoption. This chapter provides a definition of AI governance and describes the key challenges and opportunities it presents.
This chapter has th e following sections:
/SM590000âWhat is AI governance?â on page 2
/SM590000âGovernance as a key enabler for realizing AI valueâ on page 4
/SM590000âChallenges with governance of enterprise AIâ on page 6
/SM590000âAn example of legislation and standards related to AIâ on page 121

2 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance1.1  What is AI governance?
There is not one formal definition of AI go vernance that is generally accepted. Many 
organizations have created a definition that focuses on specific elements of the overall AI governance picture. The one that, in the opinion of the author, captures a broad spectrum succinctly best is this one fr om the Data & AI Alliance: 
___________________________________________________________________
âA system of rules, practices, processe s and tools that he lp an organization 
use AI in alignment with its values and strategies, address compliance 
requirements and drive trustworthy performance.
1â 
___________________________________________________________________
In other words, it is about two things. First, it is about the rules that an organization sets for 
themselves to make sure their use of AI is profitable, compliant, secure and fair. And second, it is about the methods that an organization applies to ensure and document that those rules are followed using tools as the enabler.
AI governance comprises a set of activities that run in parallel to the operational process of 
creating, deploying and maintaining AI assets. Ta ble 1-1 contrasts the typical activities related 
to different aspects of an AI solution. Many of the activities in the AI governance  column will 
be discussed in more detail in the following chapters of this Redbooks publication.

Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 3Like any business practice, AI governance can benefit from applying the people, process and 
technology (PPT) framework. When applied to AI governance, this framework helps organizations ensure that their AI systems are aligned with their strategic goals, are 
developed and deployed responsibly, and deliver  value to stakeholders. Here is a breakdown 
of how the PPT framework might apply to AI governance
2:
/SM590000People: The first element of the PPT framework focuses on the people involved in the AI 
governance lifecycle, this includes technical experts, legal advisors, compliance officers, AI asset deployment Document the technical characteristics and 
development process of the AI deployments.

4 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governancebusiness leaders, ethicists, and other stakeholders. In the context of AI governance, 
people play a crucial role in ensuring that  AI systems are designed and used ethically, 
transparently, and resp onsibly. This involves:
â Building diverse and inclusive teams
â Providing adequate training and support
â Fostering a culture of ethical AI practices
/SM590000Process: The second element of the PPT framework emphasizes the importance of 
well-defined and repeatable processes for the governance of AI systems. In the context of AI governance, processes help organizations manage risks associated with AI, ensure compliance with regulations, and maintain the quality and reliab ility of AI solutions. This 
includes:
â Defining AI principles and policies
â Establishing clear governance structuresâ Defining roles and responsibilities
â Defining decision-making frameworks
â Implementing robust change management processes
/SM590000Technology: The third element of the PPT framework focuses on the technology 
infrastructure and tools used to enact the principles, structures and processes in 
day-to-day work. In the context of AI governance, AI governance platforms provide a centralized and integrated view of AI systems, enabling organizations to govern the lifecycle of AI solutions, manage AI risks and ensure compliance. These platforms typically include features such as:
â An inventory of use cases and AI assets
â Automated workflowsâ Risk and legal assessments
â Compliance plans
â Issue managementâ Reporting and dashboarding 
1.2  Governance as a key enab ler for realizing AI value
AI governance serves as a critical enabler for organizations to unlock the full value of AI in a 
responsible and trustworthy manner. As organizations adopt AI to achieve ambitious goals, governance provides the structure needed to scale these efforts responsibly and effectively. Executives are pushing for the adoption of AI in enterprise contexts, whic h differs significantly 
from consumer-focused applications.
Scaling AI to meet these objectives is only possible when governance frameworks are firmly 
in place. Without consistent governance, or ganizations risk operational inefficiencies, 
compliance failures, brand reputation, and ethical concerns that can hinder AI adoption.
This section addresses three common concerns that people have about AI governance as an 
enabler of AI value.

Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 51.2.1  Concern 1: Gover nance is a brake on AI
In some ways this is a true statement: governance does set boundaries in the application of 
AI and then holds people to that.
But compare it to a car: what would happen if your car doesn't have brakes? How would you 
even make it out of your street without the precise control to stop at the first intersection? How would you drive on a highway if you could not make an emergency stop or reliably take an exit? How would you park your car? Without brakes you would actually never be able to 
drive fast.
We have developed a governance system to make  sure millions of people can get in cars, 
trucks and buses each day and get to their destination safely. This includes traffic laws, driver's licenses, speed limits, road si gns, technical safety devices and more.
Extending that traffic metaphor to AI, AI governance helps you:
/SM590000Educate your employees about the rules of the road so they don't need a huge level of 
oversight every time they get in their car.
/SM590000Train your employees how to drive their AI safely (for example through an Ethics by Design 
method)
/SM590000Determine when it is safe to go fast (typically large numbers of AI use cases that an 
organization agrees are low- to no-risk).
/SM590000Identify those use cases where extra care is required, and clearly lay out what the 
obligations are.
/SM590000Implement guardrails in the extra dangerous ha irpin turns to catch AI mishaps even if the 
driver is momentarily distracted.
/SM590000Maintain your brakes by adjusting your policie s and procedures as AI  continues to evolve.
Like brakes, AI governance, when applied properly, allows an organization to go fast most of 
the time.
1.2.2  Concern 2: Governance does not scale
That is absolutely true in the sense that manual and ad-hoc  governance doesn't scale.
Through the people, process, and technology ap proach referred to earlier, organizations can 
make their AI governance more systematic and use technology to automate and scale.
IBM takes this approach in our own AI governance, and we now create 100s of new and 
governed AI use cases per quarter. Governan ce can absolutely scale  to the level of a 
complex global company with large AI ambitions.
Software can help scale AI governance through:
/SM590000A single enterprise inventory  of AI use cases and assets that all parties can use for their 
specific purposes. Note that this does not mean that all AI development needs to be done on a single platform.
/SM590000Discovery  of any AI that is already in use but not yet registered (shadow AI).
/SM590000Integration with systems of record  - depending on the type of business you are in, you will 
already have an inventory of your IT systems, a product catalog and other systems of record. Use technology to leverage the information you already capture there so you do not have to redo that for governance purposes.

6 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance/SM590000Automated reports and dashboards  for specific roles and users.
/SM590000Self-service methods  to business owners to register the relevant information about their 
use cases. Such a data gathering can be maintained by and combine the needs of specialists (legal, ethics, security, etc.).
/SM590000Automated assessment  of the risk mitigation and compliance requirements for a use case.
/SM590000Automated workflows  to involve specialists, facilitate re views, resolve issues and manage 
escalation points.
/SM590000A standardized method for technical teams to  capture metadata  about the AI that they are 
developing.
/SM590000Standardized monitoring  capabilities that are mapped to  the legal obligations and 
corporate risk.
/SM590000Integration with  AI platforms and processes  to avoid duplicate work for the technical 
teams.
/SM590000Integration with any adjacent tooling  where governance requirements might be fulfilled (for 
example: security monito ring of AI systems).
1.2.3  Concern 3: Governance does no t contribute to value generation
Governance is often approached, and justified, as a way to avoid losses such as fines, 
damage to brand reputation or negative operational impact.
While this  loss avoidance  can be of substantial value to an organization, authors from the 
Notre Dame - IBM Tech Ethics Lab make the case for a holistic ROI framework that also incorporates a value generation  perspective
3 that includes amongst others:
/SM590000Building unique organizational capabilities to take advantage of market opportunities more 
quickly.
/SM590000Ability to attract and reta in talent through the or ganization's reputation.
/SM590000A sincere commitment to values-based leadership.
1.3  Challenges with governance of enterprise AI
With the rise in popularity of ChatGPT4 and other consumer AI tools, organizations have been 
looking for ways to apply thes e capabilities also to their bus iness environment. Like other 
technologies, transitioning from customer to business usage comes with specific challenges. This chapter describes the main challenges as they relate to the governance of an organization's AI initiatives.
1.3.1  Generative AI has changed the governance game
While business teams are smitten by the potential for business improvement, and the 
technical specialists are enamored by the latest technological breakthroughs, generative AI is 
different (enough) from earlier forms of AI to approach them thoughtfully.
These differences impact the governance of the AI in the following ways:

4  OpenAIs consumer chatbot  

Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 7/SM590000Generative AI enables use cases in new areas  of an organization increasing the 
complexity of governance - more use cases to review, more (types of) users to educate, 
more room for accidental errors.
/SM590000Generative AI carries amplified and new risks  such as bias in generated content, 
intellectual property concerns, hallucination, energy consumption and misinformation. 
/SM590000Generative AI has a different supply chain  - most organizations do not train their own large 
language models, but leverage pre-trained models from commercial vendors and the open-source community. These external models need to be vetted before being applied in use cases. See Chapter 4, âOnboarding a new foundation modelâ on page 41 for more on this topic.
/SM590000Generative AI introduces different assets to govern  - organizations now routinely work with 
prompt templates, foundation models (FMs), and other AI assets. These assets come with different metadata and different ways to measure their performance and robustness. Chapter 6, âGoverning the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI assetâ on page 61 for more on this topic.
/SM590000Generative AI is evolving rapidly . ChatGPT  broke through to the mainstream in 2023, in 
2024 many organizations turned to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions and AI assistants in various forms, and 2025 looks to be the year of agentic AI . Each of these 
developments also impacts how AI is governed. To help keep up, look for AI governance partners with first-hand experience in delivering these types of cutting-edge AI solutions.
Having said all that, generative AI is not repl acing machine learning (ML) - traditional machine 
learning remains a core technology in businesse s and continues to deliver value. Consistent 
governance is essential for both ML and generative AI to address overlapping and unique challenges effectively. 
1.3.2  Bring together dive rse stakeholder perspectives
AI governance is not just a matter for the technical teams. It is an organizational team sport 
that must be informed by a wide range of perspectives to address the diverse challenges associated with AI systems.
Figure 1-1 shows different perspectives typically in volved in the AI-related ârulesâ referred to 
in 1.1, âWhat is AI governance?â on page 2. 

8 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceFigure 1-1   Comprehensive AI governance involves different stakeholder perspectives
Even if an organization does not have a dedicated department for each of these, the more 
these perspectives are represen ted in an AI governance framew ork, the more effective it will 
be. Table 1-2 gives examples of which of the AI governance activities from in paragraph 1.1 are commonly informed by which perspectives. Organizations w ill need to create their own 
version of such a mapping and define the roles and responsib ilities of all involved parties.

Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 9Given this multi-dimensional nature of AI governance, organizations should be aware of 
common gaps:
/SM590000Communication gaps: AI engineers are not legal experts and vice versa, and the same 
goes for the other stakeholders. To overcome this gap, consider:
â Education programs to create a common base of understanding, without everyone 
having to know the full extent of the other's roles.
â Automated workflows to integrate everyone's contributions into a unified framework.
/SM590000Technology gaps: Indivi dual teams will be tempted to create  or deploy tooling for their 
specific piece of the AI governance puzzle. While their efforts are of course with the best of intentions, it does create an increasing in tegration problem as the company matures to 
a more interconnected approach.
To overcome this gap, look for tooling that provides integrated support all of the activities and 
roles listed in the table above. Limit the use of bespoke integration to only those situations 
where generally available AI governance tooli ng does not have the integrated capabilities.
In summary, the challenge lies no t in providing isolated capab ilities to each group but in 
ensuring that all these tools and workflows are interconnected effectively. For example:
/SM590000Do the technical teams have a clear view of the compliance re quirements they will 
specifically need to fulfill as they develop an AI solution?
/SM590000Do risk teams have a clear view of the expos ure created by using the same AI models 
across AI solutions that are created in-house and those that are purchased as part of an application?
/SM590000Does the governance solution actively support technical teams in gathering technical 
documentation details in an easy way?

alignment across the organization.
1.3.3  Technical comp lexity is increasing
As AI evolved from machine/deep learning to  generative AI, the technical complexity has 
increased in the following ways:
More complex relationship bet ween use cases and AI assets
In machine learning and deep learning projects , typically there was a very tight one-to-one 
relationship between the use case and the AI assets (models). Models were trained to perform a specific task, and if you had a different task, you would train another model. The use case comes first, and then the model(s) follow.
With generative AI and foundation models, this is typically no longer the case as these 
models are now pre-trained to handle a large variety of use cases. Not only does this mean a one-to-many relationship, but the relationship is also reversed: the model is already there before any specific use cases are considered. One result of this is that the use case has become more important as a governed item in its own right, separate from the (foundation) models applied to deliver a use case. Chapter 5 describes the governance considerations around use cases

10 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceMore AI assets
In machine learning and deep learning projects, typically the asset created was a trained 
model. Depending on the use case and the dat a, these can take many forms but they're 
generally all referred to as models .
With generative AI and foundation models, there are other types of assets used to make a 
specific use case come to life. The primary way to interact with a foundation models is 
through a prompt, which is typically text-based instructions on what you want the model to do. For many enterprise use cases, these are not one-off but repeated interactions that take the form of a parametrized prompt template. For example, for a retrieval-augmented generation use case, an LLM is prompted each time a user query comes in. The prompt always has the same structure and core instru ctions, with parameters for t he user's query and the context 
data that should be used to answer the query. See Figure 1-2 on page 10.
Figure 1-2   Example of a parametriz ed prompt template for a RAG use case
So instead of training models , a lot of projects now involve  creating prompts .
Additionally, organizations might decide to fine-tune a pre-trained model to make it fit their 
specific needs better. There are different methods to do this that result in what is effectively a new model. It is derived from the base model but is a new object in its own right that needs the appropriate amount of oversight.
Lastly, other AI techniques such as prompt chaining (where different prompts are executed in 
a defined sequence) might result in other assets to be governed.
Chapter 6, âGoverning the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI assetâ on page 61 describes the 
governance considerations for different AI assets
More sources of AI
In machine learning and deep learning projects , organizations usually train their own models, 
potentially with assistance from external service providers, using either their data or trusted 
third-party data.
With the advent of Generative AI and founda tion models, these models are typically sourced 
from third party as pre-trained models, such as IBM's Granite  family of models. However, 
organizations often lack adequate insight into the data used to train these external foundation models. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to conduct a thorough assessment and review of the foundation model before adopting it for their own use. Chapter 4, âOnboarding a new foundation modelâ on page 41 describes the governance considerations when bringing in these externally developed models.


Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 11These multi-purpose foundation models also spur on your technology providers to embed 
more and more AI in any enterprise applications that an organization might use. Chapter 4, âOnboarding a new foundation modelâ on page 41 describes the governance considerations for AI embedded in business applicat ions. Another trend to watch is  the prebuilt AI capabilities 
in devices such as la ptops and smartphones.
1.3.4  Regulatory and risk complexity is increasing 
In this section we review regulatory compliance management and operational risk 
management.
Regulatory compliance management
The AI regulatory space is very dynamic: There are many AI-specific legislations in force or in 
progress across the world, there are general regulations that also apply to AI and there are several options for volu ntary commitment schemes. 
Especially for organizations that operate across multiple regions, the regulatory challenge is 
becoming more complex quickly and one cannot expect everybody in an organization to be a regulatory expert for A I. As a result, the role of complianc e will become more prominent in the 
âteam sportâ described in 1.3.2, âBring togeth er diverse stakeholder perspectivesâ on page 7.
Luckily, regulatory compliance management is a well-establis hed discipline, which can now 
also be applied to AI. This includes actions such as:
/SM590000Defining compliance requirements and obligations
/SM590000Implementing legal assessment tools
/SM590000Connecting AI use cases with mandates
/SM590000Defining compliance plans
/SM590000Managing legal obligations across use cases (for example, AI literacy)
/SM590000Managing regulator interactions
/SM590000Managing regulatory change
/SM590000Regulatory reporting
/SM590000Documenting and reporting on compliance status
As AI is set to impact more and more busin ess processes, AI governance becomes more 
than just a legal check box. Organizations will need to de fine/update their risk frameworks 
and enterprise policies; especially as generative AI and agentic AI bring amplified and new risks to an organization.
Operational risk management
Operational risk management is also a well-established discipline, which can now also be applied to AI. This includes actions such as:
/SM590000Defining AI risks and mitigation strategies
/SM590000Implementing libraries of risks and controls
/SM590000Implementing AI risk identification tools
/SM590000Connecting AI use cases with business processes
/SM590000Defining test plans
/SM590000Managing loss events, loss impacts and loss recoveries
/SM590000Documenting and reporting on risk assessments and mitigation strategies

12 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance1.4  An example of legislati on and standards related to AI
Like AI in general, legislation and standards around AI are evolving quickly. In this chapter we 
cover some headlines and refer the reader to th e respective sources of these legislations and 
standards for their current state and planned further enhancements.
1.4.1  AI-specific legislation 
Across the world, AI-specific legislation is being developed or has been enacted. This 
paragraph describes the key characteristics of one example.
Regulation (EU) 2024/ 1689 - The EU AI Act
The European AI Act  went into force on August 1st, 2024, and is applicable to any 
organization placing AI on the market in the European Union (EU), regardless of their home base. That means that organizations headquartered elsewhere in the world do have to comply with the Act for AI systems that impact EU citizens, as consumers, employees or other 
roles.
The AI Act regulates two things:
1. âGeneral purpose AI modelsâ (the legal terminology for what we call foundation models in 
this publication).
â A special category is models with â systemic risk â - the really large models that can be 
used so widely that their potential impact is very extensive.
2. âAI systemsâ
â Some uses of AI are classified as prohibited , they are not allowed to be placed on the 
market in the EU. Examples are AI systems that use subliminal techniques, enact forms of social scoring or employ untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage.
â Some uses of AI are classified as high risk , they are allowed but come with a set of 
requirements to ensure they don't violate the rights of EU citizens. Some of these 
defined uses are industr y-specific (for exampl e in utilities, financial services and public 
sector) and some are horizontal (for example certain use cases in HR or education).
â Some uses of AI are classified as having transparency  risk, they are also allowed and 
come with obligations to disclose that a person  is interacting with an  AI system, or that 
content is created by an AI system.
An organizationâs legal obligatio ns depend on the classification  of the system or the model, 
and the role that an organization plays with respect to that system or model (such as provider, deployer, others).
The Act defines penalties for:
/SM590000Bringing prohibited AI systems onto the market.
/SM590000Not meeting the obligations for high-risk use cases and/or general purpose AI models.
/SM590000Providing incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to notified bodies or national 
competent authorities in reply to a request. 
For large enterprises, the fines can be as high as  35 million euro or 7% of its total worldwide 
annual turnover for the preceding fi nancial year, whichever is higher.
While the Act is in force sinc e August 2024, subsets of obligat ions will apply fr om different 
dates:

Chapter 1. Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 13/SM590000February 2025: prohibited AI systems, AI literacy requirements
/SM590000August 2025: obligations for providers of general purpose AI models
/SM590000August 2026: obligations for high-risk AI systems
/SM590000August 2027: obligations for high-risk AI systems â intended to be used as a safety 
component of a product, or the AI system is  itself a product, covered by the Union 
harmonisation legislation5â (for example toys or medical devices)
Other AI-specific legislation includes, for example:
/SM590000Act on the Development of Artificial Intelligen ce and Establishment of Trust (AI Basic Act) 
(South Korea)  
/SM590000Local Law 144 regarding automated employment decision tools (US, New York City)  
/SM590000Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI (US)  
/SM590000Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (Canada)  
/SM590000AI regulation: a pro-innovation approach (UK)  
1.4.2  General regulations that apply to AI
Besides the evolving AI-specific regulations there are also many general regulations that 
apply to AI use cases and systems in areas such as:
/SM590000Non-discrimination
/SM590000Privacy protection 
/SM590000Data protection
/SM590000Product liability
/SM590000Fair advertising
/SM590000Industry-specific regula tions, such as rules around financial advice
1.4.3  Technical standa rds for AI governance
In addition to regulations, there are various initiatives underway to define technical standards 
for AI systems. The standards define the state-of-the-art tools and methods that can be 
applied when creating and using AI systems.
From a governance perspective, these stan dards will provide a bas eline of âgenerally 
acceptedâ practices that organizations are encouraged to adopt.
Technical standards suppor ting the EU AI Act 
The European Commission has requested the development of a set of technical standards 
covering the following requirements:
/SM590000Risk management system for AI systems.
/SM590000Governance and quality of datasets used to build AI systems.
/SM590000Record keeping thro ugh logging capabilities by AI systems.
/SM590000Transparency and information provisions for users of AI systems.
/SM590000Human oversight of AI systems.
/SM590000Accuracy specifications for AI systems.
/SM590000Robustness specificatio ns for AI systems.
5  European Union, Article 6: Classification Ru les for High-Risk AI Systems  (Section 1, Paragraph (a))

14 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance/SM590000Cybersecurity specifications for AI systems.
/SM590000Quality management systems for providers of AI systems, including post-market 
monitoring processes.
/SM590000Conformity assessment for AI systems.
Two European standardization bodies (CEN/CENELEC) have accepted that request and 
have formed a joint technical committee (âJTC21â) for the development and adoption of standards for AI and related data. 
These technical stand ards will become important co mpliance tools since they â will grant  a 
legal presumption of conformity to AI systems develo ped in accordan ce with them.â 
In other words: if you build your AI systems to the specifications in these technical standards, the EU will assume your system is  in conformity with the AI Act.
The following list of organizations provides useful information related to AI and AI governance 
standards.
/SM590000NIST RFM 
National Institute of Standards and Technology - AI Risk Management Framework
/SM590000ISO
International Organizati on for Standard ization - Artificial Intelligence
/SM590000OWASP Top 10 for Large La nguage Model Applications
Open Web Application Se curity Project (OWASP)
Note:  Given the evolving nature of AI governance standards, a flexible approach is crucial. 
Regularly review and adopt new or updated standards as they emerge to ensure your AI systems align with the latest best practices.

16 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance2.1  Introduction to the IBM watsonx platform and its core 
components
Organizations today face a common challenge: ac cessing data that is trapped in silos across 
various systems. Business applications typically store their data in application-specific sources, which often leads to duplication across multiple systems to meet  different application 
needs. This fragmentation results in disconnected datasets that are not easily accessible to the broader enterprise ecosyst em while still maintaining appr opriate access rights. As a 
result, this limitation hinders opportunities for gaining insights and fostering innovation.
IBM AI and data platforms enable organizations to access and integrate isolated datasets for 
analytics purposes, en suring that the data is of high quality and trus tworthy. This capability 
allows companies to develop responsible and ethical solutions, fostering the creation of new products, offerings, and opportunities for business growth.
The IBM watsonx platform, along with IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is built on the robust 
foundation of Red Hat OpenShift. This next-generation AI and data platform enables enterprises to develop and deploy AI applications, access data stored in legacy systems, catalog data while implementing governance pr actices, and improve their understanding of 
data quality. It also allows organizations to establish policies and rules related to data privacy, ensuring that end-to-end AI solutions are ethical, responsible, and trustworthy.
Accessing high-quality datasets can be challenging in organizations when the data assets are 
locked in silos. The key for organizations to gain insights and bring innovation to their business is leveraging these data assets but requires a platform that enables access to data assets residing in silos, integrate the data assets, and build and deploy AI assets in an ethical and responsible way. The IBM watsonx platform consists of three core components

leverages the IBM watsonx platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This architecture is designed to build, test, deploy, manage, govern, and consume AI solutions across the enterprise.
Figure 2-2   Reference architecture for integrated AI  and data platform for an enterprise using IBM watsonx
2.5.1  Data Onboarding
The left side of Figure 2-2 illu strates the existing and legacy data sources that drive the 
organization's day-to-day operations. These data sources are often designed and developed for specific purposes and are accessible only by a select group of users or applications. 
Typically, these existing and legacy data so urces are built in silos, lacking a clear 
understanding of the relationships between the data assets they contain. To resolve this, 
organizations can use watsonx.data to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and make it directly accessible  for AI and business intelligence (BI).
To integrate these disjointed data sources, we can onboard them onto IBM's open 
architecture lakehouse, watsonx.data, which combines elements of a data warehouse and data lakes. It offers a unified platform where users can store data or connect data sources to manage and analyze enterprise data.
IBM watsonx.data allows two approaches for onboarding data into the platform:
/SM590000Accessing the data in place.


Chapter 2. Introduction to IBM watsonx.governance 23/SM590000Replicating the data onto the platform in Iceberg open data format using various extract, 
transform, and load (ETL) options.
IBM watsonx.data allows users to access data in existing data warehouses and data lakes 
through predefined platform connectors, including Teradata, Snowflake, SingleStore, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, IBM Db2, and IBM Netezza. This solution reduces data duplication, and the costs associated with storing data in multiple locations.
Suppose existing data is stored in an external storage system such as IBM Cloud Object 
Store, Amazon S3, IBM Storage Ceph, MinIO, HDFS (in Hadoop/Cloudera), Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Data Lake Storage. In that case, it can be accessed directly if the data is in Iceberg or Delta Format. If the data is stored in other common formats like Parquet or CSV, it can be accessed in its native format, followed by running ETL jobs to convert it to the open format like Iceberg and brought into the platform.
Cirata is an IBM partner that developed a cloud migration solution that automates the 
seamless transfer of continuous HDFS data and Hive metadata to watsonx.data.
IBM watsonx.data supports loading data from existing on-premises data lakes using ETL jobs 
developed with DataStage or Spark. Additionally, data loading can be done through a web console or command line interface.
Existing data sources like Db2 for z/OS, IMS, and VSAM on the mainframe can be replicated 
using IBM Data Gate in the Iceberg open data format within watsonx.data. Data Gate is a replication technology that sy nchronizes data from IBM Z to various hybrid-cloud targets.
The architecture of watsonx.data enforces schema and da ta integrity, facilitating the 
implementation of robust data security and governance mechanisms. Integrating watsonx.data with IBM Knowledge Catalog on Cloud Pak for Data provides knowledge 
workers with self-ser vice access to data as sets, allowing them to utilize these assets to gain 
insights. Once the data from these sources is onboarded into the platform in its raw format, the data assets from watsonx.data are imported into a governed catalog in IBM Knowledge Catalog, where they can be enriched with business semantics by mapping business terms to technical data assets (such as database tables and columns). Data quality can be assessed through profiling and runn ing data quality analyse s. Data protection ru les are established to 
control access to sensitive data in governed catalogs, which can include denying access, redacting columns, obfuscating columns, substituting columns, or filtering rows.
In addition, semi-structured and unstructured data and documents can be processed, split, 
and stored in the watsonx.data vector database, Milvus, along with their metadata and vector embeddings in the same datastore. Milvus is designed to store, index, and manage embedding vectors used for similarity search and retrieval-augmented generation, empowering embedding similarity search and AI applications.
2.5.2  Data Preparation
Businesses can derive a greater value by integrating data from various sources and domains into higher layers, such as t he silver and gold layers of a medallion data architecture. 
Additionally, watsonx.data provides multiple query engines, including Presto and Spark, 
allowing users to select the most suitable engine based on the characteristics of their workload. IBM watsonx.data seamlessly integrates with Db2 Warehouse and Netezza Performance Service, facilitating data sharin g across these products and enabling users to 
leverage the most appropriate engine for each specific task.

24 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceOnce structured and unstructured data is onboarded to watsonx.data in the watsonx platform, 
users can access the data assets as long as they have the necessary access rights. They can build, train, tune, and deploy tr aditional ML models or utilize ge nerative AI mode ls to enhance 
their business use cases with AI.
2.5.3  AI Buildin g and Deployment
IBM watsonx.ai provides low-code and no-code tools, including Auto AI for creating traditional 
machine learning models, Prompt Lab for prompt engineering, and Prompt Studio for adapting and fine-tuning generative AI models. Additionally, watsonx.ai offers a Studio and a Python Software Development Kit (SDK) designe d for data scientists and AI engineers to 
build, train, adapt, fine-tune, and deploy both traditional machine learning and generative AI assets.
2.5.4  AI Lifecycle Management and Governance
The IBM watsonx platform enables end-to-end AI lifecycle management and governance. IBM recommends following an end-to-end process to build AI solutions that are ethical and responsible - secure, safe, transparent, and trustworthy, as shown in Figure 2-3. 
Figure 2-3   End-to-end flow for AI life cycle and governance powered by IBM watsonx
In this approach, an AI Use Case Owner or Requestor starts by creating an AI use case in 
watsonx.governance. This involves outlining the business purpose of the use case and 
detailing how AI will be utilized to achieve the intended outcomes.
Next, the AI Use Case Owner identifies potential risks associated with the AI use case by 
answering a set of questions and conducts an initial risk assessment within watsonx.governance. Once this risk identification and assessment are completed, input from legal, HR, the AI Ethics Council, operations, security, and finance is gathered. Based on the risk analysis and risk profiles associated with the use case, a decision is made to approve or 
reject the development of the AI use case and its related assets.
If the use case is approved for development, the AI Developer, which can be an AI Engineer 
or Data Scientist, collaborates with a Data Engineer to shape and prepare the dataset in watsonx.data for either training traditional ML models or tuning large language models.


Chapter 2. Introduction to IBM watsonx.governance 25Following the data preparation, the AI Developer can build and train traditional ML models or 
adapt or tune for generative AI models specific to the use case. The AI Developer then validates these traditional ML models and AI assets leveraging generative AI models and test data to evaluate performance metrics such as F1 score and ROUGE, as well as fairness, explainability, and model health (including latency, number of  transactions, and token count).
Subsequently, a Model Validator-an independent Data Scientist or AI Engineer- evaluates the 
traditional ML model or Generative AI assets in a pre-production environment using production-like data within watsonx.governance.
An AI Risk Reviewer then examines the evalua tion performance metrics, risk scorecard, and 
model health metrics. Based on this final risk assessment, the reviewer either approves or rejects the AI asset for deployment in production within watsonx.governance.
Finally, the ModelOps Engineer deploys the approved model into production using CI/CD 
pipelines and activates ongoing AI monitoring to track key metrics, such as runtime quality, drift, fairness, explaina bility, and other relevant indicato rs specific to the use case. The 
ongoing monitoring metrics are published in the Governance Console in watsonx.governance. Each metric has associated thresholds, and alerts can be configured in the Governance Console to notify relevant stakeholders, such as the AI Use Case Owner or AI Risk Reviewer, when these thresholds are br eached. Once the appropriate parties receive 
notifications about threshold breaches, they can initiate the investigation process or follow the procedures for issue and change management, which may involve redeveloping a new version or completely different AI asset.
Facts, documentation, and evidence regarding AI assets are collected and stored in 
watsonx.governance for future reviews and audits by regulatory agencies, internal stakeholders, and external partie s. Additionally, specif ic reports related to  the AI lifecycle and 
its stages can be generated in the Governance Console of watsonx.governance.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance is a mu ltifaceted process that  ensures AI systems are 
developed and deployed responsibly and ethica lly. This chapter provides a comprehensive 
overview of the end-to-end AI lifecycle gove rnance process, exploring the various steps 
involved in achieving this goal.
This chapter contains the following sections:

28 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance3.1  Understanding the end- to-end AI lifecycle governance 
process
This section describes the governance process which is divided into two primary levels: 
macro and micro as shown in Figure 3-1. 
Figure 3-1   End-to-end AI lifecycle governance process
Macro level
The macro level encompasses high-level strategic steps such as defining legal obligations, 
articulating AI principles, and extending enterprise risk frameworks. These steps ensure that the overarching governance structure aligns with organizational values and regulatory requirements.
Micro level
The micro level involves more granular tas ks, including assigning business owners, 
performing risk assessments, and documenting go/no-go decisions. These steps ensure that day-to-day operations are conducted in a manne r that supports the macro-level objectives.
The intersection of macro and micro-level specific s dictates actions related to AI models, such 
as model approval, deployment, and monitoring . This level ensures that each AI model is 
rigorously evaluated and managed throughout its lifecycle.
The process begins with model proposal approval, where a model entry is created in the 
Model Inventory and continuously updated with new information. The data scientist then uses a tool of their choice to develop the model, with training data and metrics from popular open-source frameworks automatically captured and saved to the model entry. Custom information can also be saved.
Next, the pre-production model is evaluated for accuracy, drift, and bias, with performance 
metadata captured and synced. The model is t hen reviewed and approved for production, and 
deployed in the preferred platform, with relevant metadata captured and synced. Finally, the production model is continuously monitored, with performance data captured and synced, 


Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 29and a dashboard provides a comprehensive view  of the performance metrics for all models, 
allowing stakeholders to proactively identify and react to any issues.
This chapter will delve into the end-to-end AI lifecycle  governance proces s, highlighting the 
key personas, and components of each level and how they interconnect to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner consistent with organizational values and goals. We will also discuss the challenges an d opportunities associ ated with implementing 
this process, emphasizing the benefits of improved transparency, accoun tability, and trust.
Throughout this ch apter, we will examine the key components of each  governance level and 
discuss how they work together to ensure responsible and ethical AI development and 
deployment. By understanding these components, readers will ga in a comprehensive view of 
the governance process and its importance.
By the end of this chapter, readers will have a thorough underst anding of the end-to-end AI 
lifecycle governance proc ess. They will be able to identify  the key componen ts of each level 
and understand how they work together to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly and ethically. This kn owledge will be invaluable  for applying AI 
governance strategies within their own organizations.
3.2  Elements of model risk governance 
To convert macro-level requirements into micro-level ones, a framework is needed to map these requirements. This is achieved through the use of personas that define the high-level requirements, while watsonx.governance objects are essential for effective management and governance of AI models thro ughout their lifecycle. This chapter will explore the elements 
required to implement the AI governance strategy
3.2.1  Personas
Figure 3-2 on page 30 shows a typical governance flow which begins with defining an AI use case to solve a business problem, followed by requesting an AI asset, such as a model or prompt template, to address the issue. The process involves various roles, starting with the model owner, who defines the problem and identifies the need for an AI solution. The developer then builds the AI asset, which is subsequently tested by the validator to ensure it meets the required standards. Next, the risk officer reviews and approves the solution, taking into account organizational risk management policies. Once approved, the ModelOps engineer deploys the AI asset into production, and finally, the application developer monitors its performance, identifying areas for improvement. Throughout this process, some organizations may choose to combine certai n roles or responsib ilities, tailoring the 
governance flow to their specific needs.

30 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceFigure 3-2   Typical personas involved in a governance process ( source )
Consider the expertise required for your governance team. A typical governance plan may 
include the following roles, wh ich can sometimes be filled by the same person or, in other 
cases, represent a team of people.
/SM590000Model Owner: This individual creates an AI use case to address a business need, 
requests the model or prompt template, manages the approval process, and tracks the solution through the AI lifecycle.
/SM590000Risk and Compliance Manager/ Legal Team: This person determines the policies and 
compliance thresholds for the AI use case, such  as rules for testing fairness or screening 
output for hateful and abusive speech.
/SM590000Model Developer or Data Scientis t: This role involves working with the data in a dataset or 
a large language model (LLM) to create the machine learning model or LLM prompt template.


Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 31/SM590000Model Validator: The validator tests the solution to ensure it meets the goals outlined in 
the AI use case.
/SM590000Model Evaluator: After deployment, the app developer evaluates the deployment to 
monitor performance against the metric thresholds set by the risk and compliance manager. If performance falls below specified thresholds, the app developer collaborates with other stakeholders to address issues and update the model or prompt template.
3.2.2  Objects
Figure 3-3 illustrates the key comp onents of AI governance, whic h is a critical aspect of 
ensuring responsible and ethical AI development and deployment. The three main elements of AI governance are model risk governance, model inventory, and lifecycle tracking, and evaluation and monitoring. Model risk governance involves identifying and mitigating potential 
risks associated with AI models, such as bias, accuracy, and security. Model inventory and lifecycle tracking involves maintaining a comprehensive record of all AI models in use, including their development, deployment, and maintenance. Evaluation and monitoring involves continuously assessing the performance and impact of AI models, identifying areas for improvement, and making necessary adjustments. By implementing these components, organizations can ensure that their AI systems are transparent, accountable, and aligned with their values and goals.
Figure 3-3   A governed, trusted AI lifecycle
To implement the framework, several objects play a crucial role in ensuring the effective management and governance of AI models throughout the lifecycle. These objects interact with different personas, including Model Developers, Model Owners, Model Validators, and Model Risk Reviewers. 
Figure 3-4 on page 32 illustrates a hierarchical  framework for implem enting AI governance 
strategies, comprising three key components: Evaluation and Monitoring, Model Validation and Review, and Risk and Compliance. Such a framework enables the creation of multiple hierarchical structures, each with its own unique architecture, which can be used to organize and capture Models. One possible organizational structure could include divisions into groups such as geography, business unit, line of business etc.


32 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceFigure 3-4   Hierarchical framework for implementing AI governance
Business Entity
Business Entities are abstract representations of your business structure. A business entity 
can contain sub-entities (such as departments, business units, or geographic locations). This 
structure is used within the system to organize access rights and simplify corporate reporting needs.
For example: A bank's retail lending department is a Business Entity.
Persona interactions:
/SM590000Model Developers: Create models that meet the specific needs of the Business Entity. For 
example, a Model Developer may create a credit risk model for the retail lending department.
/SM590000Model Owners: Ensure that models are aligned with the Business Entity's goals and 
objectives. For example, the Model Owner for the retail lending department may ensure that the credit risk model is aligned with the department's risk appetite.
/SM590000Model Validators: Validate models to ensure they meet the Business Entity's requirements. 
For example, a Model Validator may validate the credit risk model to ensure it meets the retail lending department's requirements for accuracy and fairness.
Inventory
A centralized repository that organizes, documents, and maintains an enterprise-wide collection of models or AI assets, including their usage, issues, and governance activities.
Persona interaction:
/SM590000Model Owner: Interacts with the inventory to document model changes and updates, track 
issues and resolve model-related problems


Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 33/SM590000Risk and Compliance Manager: Interacts with the inventory to schedule and track model 
reviews, assign and track model risk assessments, monitor model performance and identify potential compliance risks associated with models
Inventory is primarily comprised of the following objects:
1.Use Case  - The Use Case object is a subclass of Entity and a superclass of the Model 
object. Its main function is to serve as a repository for models during development. The 
use case encapsulates both the qualitative and quantitative requirements of the AI application to be deployed. It helps define and demonstrate how a specific model can solve a particular business problem or achi eve an objective. It describes practical 
scenarios and contexts in wh ich the model will be implement ed, offering comprehensive 
insight into its intended uses and expected results. Additionally, use cases synchronize the watsonx.governance Evaluation and Monitoring Component (performance metrics and quality control) with the Model Inventory and Lifecycle Tracking Component (model reports). Changes in one are automatically reflected in the other. This ensures that users always have up-to-date information about AI models.
2.Model - The Model object represents a quantitative method, system, or approach used 
within an organization to transform input data in to quantitative estimates. This is achieved 
through the application of statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions.
The Model object captures essential information, including:
âModel Description : A detailed description of the model
âModel Ownership : Information about the model's owner
âModel Status : The current status of the model
âDevelopment Lifecycle Dates : Important dates related to the model's development
âModel Type and Category:  Classification of the model
âModel Risk Assessment data : Data related to the model's risk assessment
3.Model Deployment  - The Model Deployment object is a child entity of the Model object, 
serving as a crucial component for tracking the deployment of one or more models. The Model Deployment object is designed to:
â Govern individual usages of a Model in a production ecosystem
â Record-specific Model Versions and their deployment locationsâ Inform risk tiering of Models by highlighting the number of areas or functions supported 
by each Model
4.Model Attestation  - Model Attestation is a process that enables organizations to request 
regular sign-offs or attestations for their models. The MRG administrator initiates this process by creating a set of blank model attestations, which are then assigned to the respective model owners. These owners are re quired to answer a series of questions 
about their models and submit their completed attestations. Typically, model attestations are conducted on an annual or quarterly basis, serving as a way to verify the completeness and accuracy of a model's information, as well as the overall model inventory.
5.Model Output  - For organizations seeking a more detailed approach to model 
documentation, the model output object offers a solution. This object enables the recording of a model's outputs, with a focus on capturing the description and overview of each output from a governanc e perspective. By utilizin g the model output object, 
organizations can maintain a more granular and comprehensive record of their models' outputs.

34 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance6.Model Input  - For organizations seeking a more detailed approach to model 
documentation, the Model Input object provides a means to capture and record the inputs of a model. The object includes key fields such as:
âInput Owner : The individual or team responsible for the input
âType : The classification of the input
âStatus : The current state of the input
âDescription : A detailed explanation of the input
Additionally, a model input object can be linke d to a model output object, allowing for the 
creation of model chains at a granular level. This provides an alternative to the model link approach, offering a more detailed and nuanced understanding of model relationships.
7.Model Risk Scorecard  - Model risk assessments are a critical component of the model 
development and documentation process, as well as an ongoing requirement for models in production. To facilitate th is process, the Model Risk Sc orecard object is utilized to 
conduct thorough risk assessments. This process involves answering a series of questions about the model, which triggers a calc ulation of a risk score . This score, in turn, 
determines the model's tier, providing a clear indication of the model's risk level.
Model validation and review
During this phase, the model use case and facts collected during the development phase are utilized to validate the mo del. The goal is to ensure the mo del is functionin g as intended and 
meets the required standards.
Persona interaction:
/SM590000Model Validator reviews the model documentation and use-case. In case of any 
shortcomings, they challenge the inconsistence and clarify any unclear or missing information
To implement a model validation strategy, the following  objects are primarily utilized:
1.Review  - The review object is a critical component of model governance, serving as a 
record of all model review activities. As a child of both the model deployment and model objects, it provides a comprehensive view of review outcomes. The review object is 
designed to capture the results of various types of reviews (for example, pre- and 
post-implementation ), and reviews consumed by independent teams to ensure model integrity and effectiveness.
By utilizing the review object, organizations can maintain a ce ntralized record of all model 
review activities, facilitating informed deci sion-making and effective model governance.
2.Challenge  - The challenge object serves as a re pository for documenting and evidencing 
concerns or issues related to any part of the Model Inventory. When a challenge is raised, the response is recorded, providing a clear audit trail. As a child of both the model and model deployment objects, the challenge object ensures that all relevant information is linked and easily accessible.
There could be many factors prompting di fferent personas to challenge existing 
deployments, such as:
â Regulatory non-compliance: Models that fail to meet new or updated regulatory 
requirements
â Data relevancy issues: Models that rely on outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate data
â Performance deterioration: Models that experience a decline in performance over time

Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 35When a challenge is identified, stakeholders will review it in accordance with established 
processes to address the concerns. This may involve remediation efforts to bring the model into compliance, update the data, or improve the model's performance.
Evaluation an d monitoring
To ensure the model operates within acceptable parameters, performance metrics are 
continuously monitored to circumvent reputational and organizational risks. During the evaluation and monitoring phase, developers, model validators and ModelOps engineers interact with the platform to:
/SM590000Monitor performance metrics and thresholds.
/SM590000Analyze model outputs and detect potential issues.
/SM590000Receive alerts and notifications for threshold breaches.
/SM590000Investigate and respond to potential issues or anomalies.
/SM590000Collaborate to identify root causes and develop solutions.
Persona interaction:
/SM590000Model Validator interacts with the platform to: Monitor performance metrics and 
thresholds, analyze model outputs and detect potential issues, and identify data quality problems or biases
/SM590000ModelOps Engineer interacts with the platform to Interacts with the platform to receive 
alerts and notifications for threshold breaches , investigate and respond to potential issues 
or anomalies and collaborate with Model Evaluators to identify root causes
For evaluation and monito ring, the following object s are primarily utilized:
1.Metric  - The Metric object is used to record the definition of a performance measurement 
that an organization wants to track. This  involves setting key parameters, including:
âMetric Type:  The type of performance metric being tracked
âThreshold:  The threshold at which the metric is  considered cautionary, critical, etc.
âCollection information: Additional details about the metric's collection and calculation
2.Metric Value - The Metric Value object records the result of the metric performance 
measurement. It is designed to behave in a way to allow the organization to store time 
series results of measurement.
3.Change Request - The change request object is a critical component of model 
governance, providing a structured process for requesting, justifying, and approving changes to models after they have gone live. This object's workflows enable organizations 
to:
âRequest and justify changes: Clearly articulate the need for changes and provide 
supporting rationale
âRoute changes for approval:  Direct changes to the relevant stakeholders and 
approvers, based on the type and impact of the change
âObtain auditable approvals: Ensure that all changes are properly approved and 
documented, with a clear audit trail
The Change Request object allows for various  approval paths and levels of approval, 
depending on the nature and scope of the change. This flexibility e nables organizations to 
balance the need for control and oversight wi th the need for agilit y and responsiveness.

36 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceRisk and compliance
The increasing use of AI models in various industries has raised concerns about risk and 
compliance. AI models can pose significant risks if not properly designed, trained, and deployed, including biases, errors, and uninten ded consequences. Moreover, AI models must 
comply with various regulations and standards, such as the European Union AI Act, United States AI Executive Order, CCPA, and HIPAA, to ensure the protection of sensitive data and 
prevent harm to individuals. To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement robust risk 
management and compliance frameworks that include model risk assessments, data quality checks, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. 
Since risk and compliance management involves  identifying, assessing, and mitigating 
potential risks associated with non-compliance with external mandates and internal policies. The following components are essential to a robust risk and compliance framework:
1.Mandate  - Mandates represent external requirements that organizations must comply 
with, such as laws, regulations, and standards. When necessary, mandates can be broken down into Sub-Mandate objects, which provide a more detailed understanding of the mandate's sub-sections. This hierarchical structure enables organizations to effectively manage and comply with complex regulatory requirements.
2.Requirement  - Requirements represent specific ob ligations that an organization must 
fulfill to comply with related mandates or sub-mandates. Th ese requirements are detailed 
in the requirement object, which provides a clear understanding of what the organization needs to do to meet regulatory obligations. By detailing these requir ements, organizations 
can ensure they are meeting their regulatory obligations and maintaining compliance.
3.Policy  - Policies represent internal guidelines adopted by an organization's Board of 
Directors or senior governance body. These guidelines are designed to provide direction and oversight for the organization's operatio ns and decision-making processes. The Policy 
object is used to store and manage policy information, including the policy text, which can be stored in standardized fields or as an attachment to the object.
Policies are managed through a review and approval process, which ensures that they are 
properly vetted and authorized before being implemented. 
4.Questionnaire Assessment - Questionnaires are a powerful tool for assessing risk and 
compliance, as well as collect ing information for specific processes and asset risks. 
watsonx.governance streamlines, standardizes, and centralizes the collection of 
questionnaire-based assessment information, making it easier to gather insights from 
across the organization.
With Questionnaire Assessment object, information from business users within the 
organization can be gathered. Respondents complete the questions and submit the finished questionnaire assessment, providing valuable insights into risk and compliance.
3.2.3  Workflows
The implementation of AI governance requires structured workflows to manage the lifecycle, 
risk, and compliance of AI models and their associated use cases. This section outlines key workflows provided by watsonx.governance Model Risk Governance (MRG) , integrating them 
into the end-to-end go vernance process discussed in this chapter. These workflows facilitate 
responsible AI development, deployment, and monitoring, ensuring adherence to organizational processes and regulatory requirements. These workflows can be automated and involve multiple user interactions and feedback/approval capturing mechanisms effectively reducing the time and effort to manage the entire process of AI governance. All actions taken by users with workflows are auditable ensuring conf idence in the system 
results. Predefined workflows are provided as part of watsonx.governance, but more can be built or existing workflows can be customized through the UI designer.

Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 37These available workflows can be categorized into:
/SM590000Models : Model Candidate, Model Validation, Model Deployment, Model Risk Assessment, 
Model Attestation, Model Decommission, and Model Change Request
/SM590000Use Cases : Use Case Request, Use Case Stakeh older Review, Use Case Development 
and Validation, and Use Case Deployment Approval
/SM590000Metrics : Metric Value and Metric Value Creation
/SM590000Questionnaires : AI Assessment and Questionnaire Assessment
/SM590000Other : Challenges and Model Risk Assessment
Figure 3-5 illustrates a matrix of  various objects and personas involved in AI governance 
workflows. Each row and column represent different components and stakeholders discussed in 3.2, âElements of model risk governanceâ on page 29, showcasing their interconnected roles in executing standardized processes. Th is visualization unders cores the necessity of 
collaboration and coordination among diverse stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of AI governance workflows.
Figure 3-5   Workflows bridging governan ce and personas for standardized processes
Benefits of str uctured workflows
By integrating these workflows into the AI governance process, organizations can:
/SM590000Ensure transparency, accounta bility, and ethical compliance throughout the AI lifecycle.
/SM590000Mitigate risks effectively while adhering to regulatory requirements.
/SM590000Foster trust in AI systems through robust and scalable governance practices.
/SM590000Minimize efforts to govern the AI use cases in their entirety.
/SM590000Standardize the approval and data capture process for all the use cases.
These workflows are critical in enabling organizations to manage their AI models and use 
cases with confidence and precision, aligned with the macro and micro-level governance strategies discussed  in this chapter.
3.3  Considerations to implement AI governance strategy
Implementing an effective AI governance strategy requires careful consideration of an 
organization's unique characteristics and needs. This section outlines the key factors to consider when configuring an AI governance solution to meet the specific requirements of an individual organization.


38 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance3.3.1  Understanding orga nizational characteristics
When implementing an AI governance strategy, it is essential to consider the following factors 
that are specific to each organization:
/SM590000Geographies : Different regions have distinct regulatory requirements, cultural nuances, 
and market conditions that impact AI governance.
/SM590000Market sectors : Various industries, such as banking, telecommunications, and public 
sector, have unique challenges and requirements for AI governance.

an AI governance solution:
/SM590000Implementing legal obligations : Develop a library of mandates and assessment 
templates that reflect the organizat ion's specific legal requirements.
/SM590000Establishing a risk framework : Create a library of risks and controls, and assessment 
templates that align with the organization's risk management policies.
/SM590000Defining organizational structure : Configure business entities, roles, and 
responsibilities to match th e organization 's structure.
/SM590000Manage collaboration and access control : Use roles and access control features to 
ensure that team members have appropriate access to meet governance goals
/SM590000Developing policies and procedures : Create workflows for lifecycle governance, risk 
management, and compliance management that reflect the organization's policies and procedures.
/SM590000Develop a communication plan : Establish a plan for communication and 
decision-making, including the use of email, messaging tools, or other collaboration platforms
/SM590000Implement a simple governance solution : Start with a basic implementation and build 
incrementally to a more  comprehensive solution
/SM590000Plan for more complex solutions:  Consider extending the AI governance 
implementation to include external models, custom properties, and tailored reports
3.3.3  Leveraging out-of-th e-box product content
While configuration is necessary, it is essential to note that out-of-the-box 
watsonx.governance capabilities and product content can provid e a solid foundation for AI 
governance. This content can be used to illustrate  best practices and provide a starting point 
for customization, rather than requiring organizations to start from scratch.

Chapter 3. Implementing AI governance strategy 39By considering these factors and configuring an AI governance solution accordingly, 
organizations can establish a strong foundation for effective AI governance and set the stage 
for successful implementation of subsequent chapters' topics.
3.3.4  Example use case
When implementing an AI governance strategy , an organization should start by analyzing 
various factors including: regi ons where it operates and utilizes AI models,  the industry it 
serves, the specific AI tools and applications it relies on, its organizational structure, and its existing technology stack (for example, IBM Watson Studio ). This evaluation will help the 
organization understand its operational landscape and tailor its AI governance strategy to address its specific needs. A well-designed governance strategy enables the organization to manage cross-team collaboration efforts, control access to sensitive data, and ensure compliance with regional regulations. Additionally, it helps support the implementation of a clear communication, aligning stakeholders and providing a strong foundation for continuous 
monitoring, auditing, transparency, and acco untability over time.

model
The pace of innovation in artifi cial intelligence (AI) is high, es pecially in the development of 
newer and better foundation models. New versions of major models are regularly released, and numerous smaller models are created for specific languages, such as Danish; data types like geospatial; or business domains, such as  IT programming. Additionally, a vibrant 
open-source community ex ists, with over one million models available on Hugging Face, an 
online marketplace for open-source AI models.
That increasing choice in models means there is an increasing need for organizations to 
govern those choices.
/SM590000Organizations should define the minimal standards a foundation model needs to meet 
before they will allow it to be  applied in their use cases. Th is chapter describes the key 
considerations from the point of view of different stakeholders.
/SM590000These considerations might require a trade-off decision when the minimal standards are in 
conflict (for example, would you accept a new model that provides better performance on a certain business task, but it creates a copyright infringement risk if it's not clear where the 
training data was sourced?). Organizations should define who gets to make the decision 
and how it gets documented.
/SM590000Lastly, organizations should define the worfklow to automate the evaluation of a new 
model candidate by the various stakeholders.

42 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance4.1  Key considerations to  onboard a foundation model
When onboarding a foundation model, several key aspects must be considered to ensure a 
smooth and effective process. The following subsections outline the crucial considerations for data acquisition and preparation, data processing and filtering, model evaluation and validation, model security and robustness, and model performance monitoring.
4.1.1  Data transparency
Transparency is highly desirable as it makes information available, shareable, legible, and verifiable. In the context of training a foundation model, which involves multiple stages, transparency efforts are often targeted at different parts of the pipeline. Documentation is particularly crucial for the data pile used for training the foundation model, where gathering information on data acquisition and preparation methodologies for foundation model training is essential. 
There are frameworks, such as The Foundation Model Transparency Index , which evaluate 
the transparency of foundation models across several composite indexes, including data, data labor, data access, and others. These indexes collectively aim to assess the transparency of various aspects of model development, such as data usage, labor practices, computational resources, methodologies, and strategies to  mitigate privacy an d copyright concerns 
(Bommasani, 2024
1). 
Data scientists or AI Center of Excellence or Enterprise AI team onboarding a foundation 
model should leverage such assessments to ensure compliance with internal and external regulations and policies. 
4.1.2  Model evaluation and validation
To ensure the reliability and sa fety of large langu age models, a comprehensive evaluation 
and validation strategy is required, incorporating the following key elements
/SM590000FMEval framework: Leverage the Foundation Model Evaluation Framework (FMEval) for 
systematic, reproducible, and consistent validation and evaluation of new large language models.
/SM590000Evaluation modes: Support both fine-tuning and prompting (in-context learning) 
evaluation, with readily available academic and business benchmarks.
/SM590000Content filtering: Implement robust content filtering mechanisms to detect and mitigate the 
generation of hate speech, abuse, profanity (HAP), pirated content, malware, and other undesirable outputs.
To evaluate foundation models, a data scientist should compare the foundation model to be 
onboarded with current state-of-the-art models using a wide range of standard benchmark evaluations across top-level categories, such as:
/SM590000human exams ( MMLU , MMLU-Pro (Wang, 2024) )
/SM590000common sense ( OBQA , SIQA ), 
/SM590000reading comprehension ( BoolQ , SQuAD 2.0 ), 
/SM590000reasoning ( ARC-C , GPQA ), 
/SM590000code ( HumanEval) , 
/SM590000math ( GSM8K ),

Additionally, it is important to  evaluate for different functi ons such as tool calling, RAG 
patterns, and other target domains specific to organizational use-cases, as discovered and discussed by data scientists or AI Center of Excellence or Enterprise AI team.
4.1.3  Model security and robustness
Foundation models can be vulnerable to  various security risks, including:
/SM590000Data poisoning: Attackers can manipulate training data to compromise model 
performance or inject malicious behavior.
/SM590000Model stealing (or extraction): Attackers can steal the model itself or its weights, allowing 
them to use it for malicious purposes or create competing products.
/SM590000Adversarial attacks: Attackers cr aft specific input data (adversarial examples) designed to 
mislead the model, causing incorrect or malici ous outputs. This includes techniques like 
prompt injection, where carefully crafted prompts can manipulate the model's behavior.
Red teaming (IBM, n.d.)  is crucial for data scientists to i dentify model vulnerabilities. This 
involves ethical hackers attempting to elicit unintended and potentially harmful behavior from the model, such as generating undesirable content through adversarial attacks and prompt injection. Data scientists responsible for onboarding foundation models should employ a comprehensive approach, using a combination of internal and external, automated and manual red teaming techniques to thoroughly i dentify and mitigate weaknesses. Traditional 
security measures, such as data encryption (at rest and in transit), user access controls, and firewalls, are also essential.
4.1.4  Ensuring model health and performance
To guarantee that a model meets the desired output and performance expectations of 
end-users, data scientists should evaluate model  health metrics relative to the use cases 
expected to be delivered with this foundation model. Two key metrics to track are latency and throughput.
Latency
Latency measures the time it takes for a model to process a scoring request. It is calculated by tracking the time elapsed between rece iving a request and generating a response, 
typically measured in millisecon ds (ms). This metric helps i dentify any delays or bottlenecks 
in the model's processing pipeline.
Throughput
Throughput measures the number of scoring requests and transaction records that a model can process per second. This metric indicates the model's ability to han dle a high volume of 
requests efficiently.

4.2  Considerations for legal team for approving a new 
foundation model
The Legal Team must have special considerations when approving a new Foundation Model. 
What kind of license is attached to the foundation model? Who owns the model? Does 
indemnification apply to the new Foundation Model in review? This  section will cover how 
watsonx.governance can be used to answer these questions and more.
4.2.1  Model licensing
Standard software licensing applies to all foundation models and is a great place for the legal team to begin. Once foundation models are published, they are packaged with a license which provides a great depth of detail as to how the model can and should be used. These licenses can be found at multiple places. In  watsonx.governance, the model license can be 
found attached to Model cards. You can access the model card by using the hamburger menu and clicking through Inventory â Models â Choose a specific model . The license will be 
listed under Development/Training. The model license can also be found on the model card in watsonx.ai, under terms. Finally, before the acceptance of a foundation model onto the watsonx.governance platform, a legal team may obtain the model License through the official publication page. As of this wr iting, any model which is public ly available can have its license 
checked through the huggingface.co  hub. Table 4-1 highlights several common model 
licenses.
Table 4-1   Some common Model Licenses
Terms and conditions at tached to AI assets
Not all AI assets come with a simple model license. For example, much of the popular OpenAI 
models are not covered under these licenses. In  cases like these, additional questions must 
be answered. A legal team may want to sit directly with model providers and other teammates such as the data science team to gain a thorough understanding of the foundation model. Some of the questions to ask may be:
/SM590000What sources of data are used to train the model?
/SM590000What are the terms and co nditions under which this  model will be made available?
/SM590000Are there contractual limitations on the use cases that the model can be used for (facial 
recognition, military, any non-research use)? License Name Summarization
Apache 2.0 License A permissive free software license that allows users to use, modify, 
and distribute the licensed software, including in commercial 
products, without paying royalties to the original authors.
Llama Community License Similar to Apache 2.0 but in addition, if the monthly active users of 
the products or services made avai lable by or for the licensee is 
greater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding 
calendar month, the licensee must  request a license from Meta, 
which Meta may grant to the licensee in its sole discretion. 
MIT License Similar to the Apache 2.0 license. This license is succinct and 
permissive for ensuring open ownership of software. 

Chapter 4. Onboarding a new foundation model 45/SM590000Are there indemnification limitations (such as, no indemnification for customer-facing 
use)?
/SM590000What is the carbon footprint of the training for this model?
By answering these and other questions, a legal team may make the educated decision as to 
whether or not to onboard the foundation model.
Intellectual property ownershi p in generative AI deployments
Beyond the ownership of the foundation models themselves, several critical intellectual 
property considerations arise when deploying generative AI. These concerns extend to the 
software used to package and deploy these models, as well as the input data provided and the output generated. Therefore, thorough discussions with legal counsel and the model/software provider are essential. Key questions to address include:
/SM590000Training Data Ownership and Licensing: Does the model provider possess clear legal 
rights (including ownership or valid licenses) to use all data incorporated into the model's training dataset? This is crucial for avoidi ng potential copyright infringement claims.
/SM590000Copyrighted Material Exclusion: What sp ecific measures has the model provider 
implemented to identify and exclude copyrighted material from its training data? Understanding their methodology is vital for assessing the risk of IP issues.
/SM590000Customer Data Usage for Model Training: Does the model provider use customer data to 
further train or refine its models? If so, what mechanisms are in place to allow customers to opt out of such usage? Transparency and control over data usage are paramount.
/SM590000Fine-Tuned Model Ownership: If the model pr ovider offers fine-tuning services, who 
retains ownership of the intellectual property rights in the resulting fine-tuned model: the provider or the customer? This needs to be clearly defined in contractual agreements.
These points should be carefully reviewed to ensure compliance with in tellectual property law 
and protect the interests of all parties involved. More on this will be covered in section âLegal 
indemnificationâ on page 46.
Local and national law implications
AI legislation has advanced at different rates throughout the world. The only thing that is 
common across all government bodies is that they are all putting forth some effort to regulate AI usage. It is not in the scope of this book (and would be challenging) to document all of the world's efforts to regulate AI. This section will provide a brief introduction to  two different 
methods that have been used to implement AI Regulation - State level, and National level. At the state level, we will quickly introduce how the United Stat es has been implementing AI 
regulation. At a national level, we mention the EU AI act in Western Europe. 
This section has two following subsections - Implications in the United States, and 
Implications in Western Europe. These two examples are meant to serve as a comparison to how a government may enforce its AI policies. Legal teams should consult their respective Local and National laws for specifics.
Implications in the United States
Before approving any foundation model, it is critical to review local and national regulations as it applies to the industry. In the US, many state laws are beginning to form which work to govern the usage of AI. The legal team should be aware of any relevant law and perform the appropriate questioning to cover these. Some  examples of passed legislation in the US 
include:

46 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance/SM590000NYC Local Law 144 - Implemented in 2021, the first law in the United States requiring bias 
auditing against AI tools. New York has propo sed more than 30 additional AI laws since 
then, with almost all still in Propo sal or Failed as of this writing.
/SM590000Tennessee ELVIS Act - Signed into law on March 21, 2024. This law protects the voices of 
Artists from all disciplines against AI-generated deepfakes created without their permission.
/SM590000Colorado Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence Ac t - Signed into  law May 17, 
2024. The act requires high-risk AI systems to use reasonable safeguards to protect consumers from 
algorithmic discrimination .
In October of 2022, The United States Federal Government also published guidance which 
could serve for legal conversation s under the name of âBlueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.â This 
document outlines important topics which should be considered by the larger team when onboarding a Foundation Model. As of this writing, the blueprint serves only as guidance and does not enforce any official Federal law.
Implications in Western Europe (The European Union)
For completeness of consideration, the legal team must review any candidate Foundation Model and how it relates to the EU AI Act. Th e Act defines a specific set of obligations for 
providers of general purpose AI models (as foundation models are called in its legal terminology). In addition, the European Union will provide an as sociated Code of Practice 
which is planned to be  approved in or before May 2025. The ob ligations and the Code will 
give buyers some concrete expectation towards a provider of a model that's brought onto the market after the Act has gone into force (August 2024).
Note that foundation models already on the market before entry into force, need to be 
compliant by August 2nd, 2027. Vendors might decide to withdraw their model from the market before that date to avoid the compliance implications. Don't wait too long to engage your existing model providers to understand th eir intent and plan for compliance, and make 
sure you have a plan yourself to switch models when needed.
Users of foundation models have no specific obligations, beyond what might result from the AI 
system(s) that use that foundation model.
4.2.2  Legal obligations on the part of the vendor
Any vendor of AI is tied to the same local and national laws as mentioned earlier. In addition, 
most of the earlier section around model licensing also applies to the vendor. One more important topic left to cover is the topic of Legal Indemnification. In law,  indemnification (or an 
indemnity) is any undertaking by one party to protect another party of some financial burden.
 In AI, the usage of foundation models can expose parties to novel financial burdens. As such, 
a major effort has been put forth around the idea of legal indemnification from AI models. This next subsection will cover this point.
Legal indemnification
AI has been controversial in its effects and re percussions. Countless lawsuits have risen 
against AI companies, because of this, a growing need of consumers of AI is to be indemnified against any legal repercussions. Every AI producer has a different position on indemnification and therefore, specifics must be explored on a per-foundation model basis. By approaching the legal review of Foundation Models in a systemic way, the legal team can ensure that an AI program will be implemented with proper co ntrol and in a safe and legal 
way.

Chapter 4. Onboarding a new foundation model 474.2.3  A final note on  legal considerations
As was covered in the earlier sect ion of the US Blueprint for AI Bill of Rights, no t all measures 
of AI safety are required by law. Legal consider ations typically follow the letter of the law, but 
this is not the end of the story for what dangers an un-controlled AI system could pose. Even with all relevant legal details be ing covered, th e ethics behind any AI  effort must still be 
questioned. 
It is also important to note that many laws a nd regulations are vague in their definitions and 
guidance. Similar to other types of technology-focused requirements, those for AI require broad statements as to not grow stale shortly after going into effect given the current speed of evolution in the industry. For these reasons it is important to approach any requirement that is new or without established precedent with a conservative and ethical mindset.
The next section 4.3, âEthical considerations for approving a new foundation modelâ on 
page 47 will focus on this topic of AI ethics.
4.3  Ethical considerations for approving a new foundation 
model 
With AI usage gaining momentum, there is an increased focus on the ethical aspect of 
understanding how a foundation model is trained and any ethical risk it can expose if it is in used as part of an enterprise use case. When considering a new foundation model, an ethical stakeholder will want to consider at least the following dimensions.
4.3.1  Fairness
An AI system or a model should be fair and free of any direct or indirect bias in its prediction. 
With the AI system using a foundation model, the foundation model itself needs to be evaluated for fairness.
Bias can be detected by evaluating the found ation model for differences in accuracy and 
performance by using social de mographic-protected attributes.
A model can exhibit fairness issues in various wa ys. If the model is looked at in isolation and 
without sufficient context, it might not appear to exhibit a favorable or unfavorable outcome. In other cases, the model output can decide the prioritization level and can introduce bias in the entire end-to-end process where the source of bias is tied to the model behavior. 
It is critical that the business owners, stakeho lders, and designers look at the model in the 
context of the overall ecosystem where the training, testing, or the production of data is generated, how the model is developed and evaluated, and where the model is being used to decide different ways in which the model might lead  to a biased outcome. This is a key step in 
the overall methodology relating to bias detection.
It is important to note that bias in some attributes of a model might be reasonable. For 
example, a foundation model that is fine-tuned to pre-screen loan applications might be biased against people with poor credit. This is deemed as reasonable. Since most model bias 
is injected unwittingly through skewed data or constrained training methods, it cannot be effectively detected and resolved exclusively through manual testing or checklist validations. 

48 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance4.3.2  Transparency
With AI usage gaining momentum, there is an increased focus on the transparency aspect of 
the foundation models for audit purposes. There are various governance, risk, compliance, or regulatory needs for information covering the nature and intended uses of the foundation model. Transparency about the model's overall accuracy, its ability to explain particular 
decisions, its fairness regarding protected cl asses, and information about the provenance of 
training data and assurances that suitable privacy protections have been maintained, all should be properly documented and available for audit purposes.
Transparency builds the trust in the AI system by increasing the unde rstanding of how the 
model was created and deployed and enabling th e ability to control how AI is created and 
deployed. This can prevent undesirable situations, such as a model training with unapproved data sets, models having biases, or mode ls having unexpected performance variations. 
This documentation of facts about the foundation model (for example model cards) can have 
the following properties:
/SM590000It can vary in content and are tailored to the particular foundation model being 
documented.
/SM590000It is tailored to the needs of their target audience or consumer documenting the tasks the 
foundation model can be used for.
/SM590000It captures the details about the data the foundation model has been trained on.
/SM590000It includes the information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or 
other applied approaches, and features.
/SM590000It shows the benchmark accuracy documenting the performance of the model.
/SM590000It contains information about the model owner (organization), model version, as well as the 
license model can be used with. 
4.3.3  Privacy
An important aspect to build trust in an AI system or model is to take measures to manage and safeguard foundation models and its data that is trained on Personal Information (PI). If a model is trained on PI without applying any sp ecific privacy techniques, and that model is 
made publicly available or shared with a nontrusted third party, the model might reach the wrong hands, and potentially violate the privacy of the people whose information was used in 
training it. PI must be properly handled and safeguarded wherever it is stored or used in the organization.
The same safeguards must be applied for models trained on proprietary, intellectual, 
copyrighted and confidential information.
Model providers must implement measures to prevent data leakage during inference. This 
includes:  
/SM590000Data minimization: Process only the absolute minimum amount of user data necessary for 
the model to function.
/SM590000Differential privacy: Apply noise to user data or model outputs to enhance privacy and 
make it difficult to identify or isolate individual contributions.
/SM590000Federated learning: Train models collaborati vely across multiple  decentralized data 
sources using techniques like federated learning, thereby avoiding the risks associated with centralizing sensitive user data

Chapter 4. Onboarding a new foundation model 49/SM590000Model monitoring: Continuously monitor model behavior for signs of unexpected data 
leakage or privacy violations.
/SM590000Transparency and user control: Provide users with clear information about how their data 
is used by the model and offer options for controlling data access and sharing.
4.3.4  Explainability
AI systems are increasingly us ed to inform high stakes de cisions. Explainability and 
interpretability of these systems and the models within the system are beco ming essential. 
There are many ways to explain these models and systems, the appropriate choice depends 
on the usage context and type of explanatio n that is needed by the consumer of the 
explanation.
4.3.5  Robustness
An AI system is considered robust if it can continue to perform well and reliably even when 
faced with difficult or unexpected situations. These situations can include anything from slight changes in the data it receives  to deliberate attempts to tr ick or manipulate the system. A 
robust AI system is designed to handle these challenges effectively, minimizing mistakes and providing consistent and trustworthy results.
4.3.6  Third-party help
There are third-party evaluations to help you und erstand various ethical characteristics of a 
foundation model you are considering using.  Use these tools to speed up your model 
onboarding process.
Two examples from the Standard Center for Research on Foundation Models:
/SM590000Foundation Model Transparency Index  - This index scores foundation models on 100 
transparency indicators ac ross several dimensions.
/SM590000AIR-Bench  (short for âAI risk benchmarkâ - This benchmarks scores foundation models on 
an extensive safety taxonomy that covers co ntent safety risks, societal risks, legal and 
rights-related risks, and syst em and operational risks.
There are many ot her options available. A quick web sear ch will give you plenty of options to 
consider.
The IBM AI Ethics Board has published an extensive overview of AI risks, called the AI Risk 
Atlas . It lists several specific risks in the ethics dimensions listed in this paragraph. Each risk 
comes with a description, categorizations, and links to examples of that risk in third-party publications whenever possible.
4.4  Considerations for financial stakeholders for approving a 
new foundation model 
A stakeholder from a Finance function will want to consider at least the following dimensions 
when considering a new foundation model.

50 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance4.4.1  Total cost of ownership
First, what is the sum total of the costs associated with acquiring and using another 
foundation model? Many models are available un der a âfreeâ license, but there's more to the 
total cost of ownership than that.
What is the init ial investment?
/SM590000What are the initial license costs to acquire the foundation model? This might take the 
form of a license for a model specifically, but could (also) include licenses for a platform that the model is hosted on. Based on existi ng vendor relationships, discounts might be 
available. As the market for generative AI evolves, new pricing models might appear.
/SM590000What are the costs to onboard this new model ? Consider procurement, IT, legal, security 
and other cost components. The assessment that is the topic of this chapter is part of such an onboarding process and comes with a cost.
/SM590000What are the costs of skills development to use this new m odel effectively? Consider 
training for administrators, data scientists, risk management and other relevant roles.
What are the run costs?
/SM590000If the model is deployed as SaaS, what are the charges for inferencing? Foundation model 
inferencing is typically charge d by the number of calls to the model and/or the number of 
tokens processed/generated by the model. Pricing models might differ, as does the amount charged for comparable numbers of calls/tokens.
/SM590000If the model is deployed in-house, what are the total costs over the foreseeable lifetime of 
this investment? Consider hard ware, electricity, cooling, personnel and all other relevant 
cost components. These costs will depend on the technical specifications of the model, 
such as the number of parameters or the model architecture.
4.4.2  Return on investment
Second, how will the investm ent in another foundation model pay back for itself?
Existing use cases
Will this foundation model allow us to execute existing use ca ses better/cheaper/faster? How? 
How much? How well does it align with our st rategic imperatives? Consider the following 
factors, and the interplay between them:
/SM590000Improve the accuracy of an existing application.
/SM590000Improve legal indemnification for an existing application.
/SM590000Improve the ease of governing one or more existing applications.
/SM590000Reduce AI ethics risk for an existing application.
/SM590000Reduce inferencing costs fo r an existing application.
/SM590000Reduce energy consumption for an existing application.
New use cases
Will this foundation model allow us to enabl e new use cases? How? How much? How well 
does it align with our strategic imperatives? For example:
/SM590000The new model has been tuned to handle IT optimization use cases better than our 
existing models, so we can now enable our IT developers to use generative AI and enhance their productivity by X%.

Chapter 4. Onboarding a new foundation model 51/SM590000The new model has been tuned to handle the Dutch language better than our existing 
models, so we can now enable a conversational assistant for our Dutch customers and improve first-time resolution by Y%.
4.4.3  Build or buy
Instead of creating a solution ourselves with a new foundation model, can we buy tooling that already does that? As more applications become AI-enabled, the benefits of buy rather than build could be:
/SM590000Achieve the projected benefits faster with a turn-key application.
/SM590000Enhanced functionality from a specialist vendor compared to what we could deliver in a 
first stage ourselves.
/SM590000Focus scarce internal AI resources on  the most strategic AI projects.
4.4.4  Exit strategy
The speed of innovation in AI is very high, how easily can we change course if something 
better comes along? Consider aspects such as:
/SM590000Contractual cancellation periods.
/SM590000Non-recoverable license, support or services costs already committed.
/SM590000Early termination fees.
/SM590000Charges to extract our data/IP/solutions from a vendor's platform.
/SM590000Portability of assets and skills to a new solution.
4.4.5  Other factors
Lastly, there might be factors not yet considered  by other stakeholders that would fall to the 
finance team in an organization. For example:
/SM590000Risks - many risks will already have been addressed by other stakeholder s as described in 
the previous paragraphs in this chapter, but there might be specific ones to be addressed by the Finance function.
/SM590000Sustainability - how does a new foundation model impa ct the organization's ESG 
(environmental, social, and governance) posture? How does it impact our direct and indirect emissions or freshwater usage?
/SM590000Security - How does the model vendor protect the organization against adversarial 
attacks, data leaks and other security risks?

Â© Copyright IBM Corp. 2025. 53Chapter 5. Assessing a new use case
A use case in watsonx. governance is the starting point to solve a business problem using an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) asset, such as a mode l or prompt template as  part of the solution. 
The process of assessing a new use case for an organization involves following a business process facilitated by a workflow engine. This  process identifies risks, assesses applicable 
regulations and policies, and decides whether to approve or reject the use case from development through production to decommissioning.
This chapter covers the following topics:
/SM590000âBusiness process workflowâ on page 54
/SM590000âApproval workflowâ on page 55
/SM590000âRisk identification assessmentâ on page 56
/SM590000âApplicability assessmentâ on page 585

54 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance5.1  Business process workflow 
The typical business process to assess a new use case, shown in Figure 5-1, combines 
automated workflows in watsonx.governance with manual checks and balances to ultimately 
approve or reject a use case and record the transparent process and findings along the way. This process can always be customized to fit an organization's specific needs.
Figure 5-1   Typical use case assessment process workflow leveraging watsonx.governance
The typical process flows as follows:
/SM590000Propose the use case: The process starts with a member of the business proposing a use 
case within the watsonx.governance console. The creator could be any member of the business who originates the problem to be solved. Typically, this would be a member of a business line, but could also be technical depending on the problem to be solved.
/SM590000Questionnaire Assessments: Once the use case is created, watsonx.governance creates 
assessment questionnaires to be completed by the business line and necessary technical teams. The answers to these questions allo w watsonx.governance to auto-populate the 
use case with applicable risks from the IBM AI  Risk Atlas that will ne ed to be addressed 
during the life of the use case. 
/SM590000Applicability Assessments: It is important to ensure your us e case will rema in compliant 
with external regulations, such as the EU AI Act in Europe. Once a use case is created, 
watsonx.governance will create an EU AI Act applicability assessment to determine if the 
use case is complaint or at risk of violating the mandates of this regulation. While the EU AI Act Assessment is installed with watsonx.governance, additional assessments are available from IBM partners for regulations that may be applicable in other regions.
/SM590000SME Review: Once the use case and the appropriate assessments are completed, a 
subject matter expert (SME) will review the auto -populated risks and further enrich the use 
case with mandates, processes, and policies that could be affected by the identified risks. The SME can also setup controls to address issues that arise after the use case is approved for the next steps in the development lifecycle. watsonx.governance can help to automate the assignments of the mandates, processes, policies and controls through custom workflow created to accommodate the specific needs of the organization.


Chapter 5. Assessing a new use case 55/SM590000Stakeholder Review & Approval: Once SME review is complete, required business 
stakeholder will be automatically notified by wa tsonx.governance  to review the use case 
and approve or reject the case . They will also be asked to provide comments to explain the 
review decision. The number of stakehol ders notified can be automated via a 
watsonx.governance workflow or pre-defined in a use case template depending on organization needs.
/SM590000Use Case Approved for Development: If all stakeholders approve of the use case, 
watsonx.governance marks it as âApproved for Developmentâ. This provides audited 
authorization for development of the solution to begin and marks the end of the initial use case assessment.
5.2  Approval workflow
Once a use case is created in the watsonx. governance console, a use case approval 
workflow is triggered by the watsonx.gove rnance console, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2   The default use case approval workfl ow executed in the watsonx.governance console
The use case approval workflow and a revi ew and approval process that collects key 
information about the use case and captures the approval or rejection of the use case from the identified stakeholders, guiding those users through all required actions along the way.
While any workflow can be customized to the needs of any organization, the steps in the 
default use case approval workflow are:
/SM590000Start: This step in the flow begins the moment a new use case is created. The creator is 
required to provide a name for the use case, and use case owner, a description of the use case, and a primary Business Entity. Optionally, the creator may also provide the purpose of the use case and its type. There are two default use case types: AI or Non-AI.
/SM590000Use Case Data Gathering: Once the use case is created, the approval workflow moves to 
gather more detailed information about the use case to be governed. At this stage, the use case owner or risk assessor can provide the initial assumed risk level, identify the stakeholders who will provide fi nal approval, and identify the technical owner of the use 
case. It must also be determi ned if the use case will lever age foundation mo dels during 
this stage in the workflow. Once all the required information is complete, the user can submit the case for Initial Approval.


56 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance/SM590000Initial Approval: In this stage, the use case owner completes a Risk Identification 
assessment questionnaire and validates a series of risks automatically assigned based on answers provided. In addition, the use case owner can optionally complete and applicability assessmen t questionnaire for the EU AI Act. Completion of the Risk 
Identification assessment is required to move to the Stakeholder Review stage.
/SM590000Stakeholder Review: At this stage, the stakeholders identified in the Use Case Data 
Gathering stage are notified to review the use case details, provide comments and approve or reject the use case for development. The use case cannot be approved unless all stakeholders have provided approval. On ce all stakeholders have approved the use 
case, it is placed in âApproved for developmentâ status. The owner and technical owner of the use case are automatically notified when the use case has been approved for development.
5.3  Risk identification assessment
As part of the Initial Approval stage of the us e case assessment workflow, the use case owner 
or risk assessor completes a risk identifi cation assessment created by an assessment 
workflow in the watsonx governance console, as seen in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3   Risk Identification Workflow as  seen in the watsonx.governance console
A risk identification assessment is a dynamic q uestionnaire that identifies applicable risks 
from the IBM Risk Atlas based upon answers provided as seen in Figure 5-4 on page 57. 


Chapter 5. Assessing a new use case 57Figure 5-4   Dynamic assignment of use case risks based on risk assessment answers
Risks assigned are determined based on a âif this , then thatâ selection structure as seen in 
Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5   Dynamic risk applicability  assignment selection structure rules
Once assigned, each risk must be evaluated and appr ove or rejected for applicability for the 
use case. These risks are the primary bases for assessing and managing risk throughout the lifecycle of your use case. Wh ile risks are assigned from th e IBM Risk Atlas by default, 
additional risks or risk sources can be added as required by an organization.
Once all assigned risks have been approved or re jected, the use case can be approved for 
stakeholder review and defined in the primary use case approval workflow.


58 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance5.4  Applicability assessment
Applicability assessment, as seen  in Figure 5-6, should also be completed by the use case 
owner as part of the Initial Approval stage of the use case assessment workflow.
Figure 5-6   Applicability Assessment Workflow  as seen in the watsonx.governance console
This assessment enables the use case owner to assess their AI use cases using a simple 
dynamic questionnaire that aids in determining whether a use case is in scope for government regulations (such as the EU AI Act ) and which risk category the use case aligns 
to (Prohibited, High, Limited, Minimal,  Out of Scope) as seen in Figure 5-7.

Â© Copyright IBM Corp. 2025. 61Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end 
lifecycle of an AI asset
Lifecycle governance is a majo r pillar of the IBM AI Govern ance framework. This pillar 
represents the idea that any AI asset should be tracked throughout the lifetime of its usage, without gaps in lineage  or traceability. 
Regardless of where the AI asset originates from, watsonx.governance comes with tooling to 
monitor performance and also to  monitor the lifecycle stage that  the asset is in. Lifecycle 
governance applies to traditional ML/AI use cases as well as generative AI.
End-to-end lifecycle govern ance results in increased efficiency through automated 
evaluations of models as well as the publishing of evaluation results and metrics. This also introduces traceab ility, auditability, and en hanced project management  capabilities through 
transparent ML/AI asset lifecycle management functionality. 
This chapter has th e following sections:
/SM590000âWhat is the AI lifecycle?â on page 62
/SM590000âMetrics in watsonx.governanceâ on page 64
/SM590000âHow to implement Lifecycle Governanceâ on page 66
/SM590000âLifecycle implementation and considerationsâ on page 676

62 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance6.1  What is the AI lifecycle?
Before reading through how watsonx.governance defines the lifecycle of an AI asset, it is 
useful to review the general lifecycle for data projects. 
Figure 6-1 represents the CRISP-DM methodolog y which encapsulates an industry-standard 
blueprint for completing data mining or data science projects.
Figure 6-1   The CRISP-DM Methodology (Cross- industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
Because AI is a form of machine learning (albeit a very large and complex version), every 
step of the CRISP-DM applies to the AI lifecyc le during initial found ation model development 
(commonly referred to as model pretraining.) Differences begin to appear when we consider an AI asset after it has been developed. It is unreasonable to expect every enterprise to train their own model from scratch. For this reason, in virtually every case, citizen engineers and scientists will engage with AI asse ts which have already been pr e-trained, and therefore, a 
modified version of the CRISP-DM methodology should be used when considering the lifecycle of an AI asset.
The pre-trained nature of foundation models allows us to create a more focused view on the 
lifecycle of AI assets being used in use case s. This lifecycle can be generally depicted with 
three chronological stages:  Develop stage, Validate stage, and Operate stage .
Figure 6-2 on page 63 highlights the general lifecycle stages in a red box.


Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 63Figure 6-2   A Sample Lifecycle Diagram
Within each stage of this AI lifecycle, action s should be taken by users to progress the AI 
asset through its lifecycle. The following section cove rs the high-level activities that take place 
within each of the three stages.
Development stage
In the development stage, users must work to stand up the initial AI use case solution. As 
described in Chapter 4, âOnboarding a new foundation modelâ on page 41 and Chapter 5, âAssessing a new use caseâ on page 53, the AI use case will go through an approval process 
before being worked on by the appropriate pr actitioners. Once the approval process is 
complete, an engineer may begin to develop the technical assets for the AI use case. The engineer can achieve many things in this st age. Prompt engineering, parameter tuning, and 
solution experimentation all fall within the deve lopment stage. For trad itional ML, this stage 
also includes activities such as feature en gineering, exploratory data analysis, and other 
pre-processing tasks which go into the model development process.
Validation stage
After development efforts are co mplete, the validation stage of the life cycle is started. This 
stage represents the process of putting development efforts through testing. An independent practitioner such as an AI engineer or data scientist can use IBM's watsonx.governance to 
run automated Prompt Evaluations, which will re turn evaluation metrics for the given AI use 
case. A programmer can also use custom code to run evaluations. Note:  In traditional ML use cases, we also split use Testing stages in addition to validation 
stages. This will be covered in t he considerations section for ML.


64 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceSimilarly, for traditional ML, validation is achieved through the traditional data science 
approach of utilizing validat e/test datasets to unde rstand model performance.
Using watsonx.governance, the validation stage represents our first opportunity at automating 
otherwise lengthy evaluations of ML and AI models. It is the first glance of how our models may perform against performance metrics such  as readability for Q&A LLM use cases, or 
accuracy for classi fication use cases.
Operation stage
The operation stage represents any AI or ML asset which reaches production-level efforts. In 
this stage of the AI lifecycle, the model asset is live and consumed by users. Model 
monitoring and asset lineage become central at this stage. The IBM watsonx.governance platform provides tools for monitoring critical asset metrics such as drift, fairness, and bias.
Before diving into implementation, the next section will briefly review the different kinds of 
metrics that can be utilized during lif ecycle governance with watsonx.go vernance.
6.2  Metrics in watsonx.governance
The metrics in this section are by no means exhaustive and watsonx.governance is capable 
of implementing custom monitors  and metrics based on user ne eds. The ability to add custom 
monitors and metrics sets watsonx.governance apart from its competitors in the market. This section gives an overview to some of the most common and important kinds of metrics that can be applied to assets for effective lifecycle monitoring.
6.2.1  Drift detection
Users can configure Drift v2 evaluations  in watsonx.governance to measure changes in their 
data over time to ensure consistent outcomes  for the model. These evaluations can be used 
to identify changes in the model output, the accu racy of your predictions, the distribution of 
the input features, the metadata and more.
The drift in the user deployments is always detected in comparison to a baseline data. This 
baseline data needs to be a good representation of the ideal dataset that the user is expecting in their deployment. It can be the training data used to train the predictive model, the test data used to validate the model, or even the past production data. As part of the monitor configuration process, certain computations are learned on the baseline data to learn the data patterns. These can vary from dividing  data in frequency bins to learn the density 
functions of your input features ( feature drift ), to training auto-encoders to learn the context 
represented by the embeddings ( embedding drift ), training proxy/meta models to learn user 
model behavior ( model quality drift ) and to look at how the meta data like character counts and 
word counts is changing ( input and output metadata drift ). Any change in the data is reported 
as a metric on different dimensions. 
6.2.2  Explainability
For the predictive AI models, watsonx.governance gives users a sneak peek into the black box by giving localized explanations to understand how the different feature values are impacting the outcomes of the specific transact ions. By aggregating these local explanations 
for a sample of such transactions, a global explanation is presented so that the user can understand the general factors that are influencing the model decisions. 

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 65To this end, wats onx.governance utilizes both  open-source algorithms ( LIME and SHAP ) and 
IBM ResearchÂ® built contrastive explanations. By generating and analyzing data points, in 
the vicinity or the local neighborhood of a given transaction, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations or LIME can tell which features of a structured record, words 
and phrases from a text paragraph, and which areas of the image are responsible for the model outcome. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanati ons) is rooted in game theory as it uses 
the classic Shapley values, to determine how much of each of the features has contributed to the model prediction. IBM Research built contrastive explanations that look at the neighborhood of a given data point, to determine how much of a delta change is required in the input features to flip the model outcome or to maintain the same outcome. A highly important feature in this case is a feature to wh ich the model is least se nsitive as they require 
a large change in the value for model to flip the outcome.
6.2.3  Model health
To understand the model health and performance of a given model deployment (for both predictive AI and generative AI AI-based models), it is imperative to know the how the said deployment is being used. To aid with that, watsonx.governance helps in calculating and visualizing the total number of scoring requests  received by the deployment in a given time 
period. Across these requests, common statistical attributes like minimum, maximum, mean, and median of the number of records  are also calculated. It is also important to know how 
much time is taken by the system to process a record and/or a request. Similarly, watsonx.governance can also measure throughput of the system by looking at the number of 
records and requests processed in a second. For generative AI-based deployments, the input and output token counts processed across the scoring requests can be visualized as well. If 
there are multiple users registered on the system and using the deployments, watsonx.governance can also present the real-tim e view to see the total number of users and 
the aggregated views to see the average number of users.
6.2.4  Generative AI quality
To assess the quality of the content generated by a prompt, watsonx.governance has many Generative AI Quality metrics. Some of these metrics work in the presence of a reference input and hence work off the feedback data. However, there are reference free metrics as well, that do not require any reference input and can be calculated on the production data.
IBM watsonx.governance also allows the use of widely available LLM models to evaluate the 
performance of the user prompts through the LLM-as-a-judge feature.
6.2.5  RAG quality metrics
By adding external sources of context to the prompt of an LLM, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance the quality of the content generated by the model. With this perspective in place, watsonx.governance can monitor both the phases of a RAG-based 
system. 
The retrieval phase can be assessed by looking at the context pulled and seeing how relevant 
it is to the question asked by the user (context  relevance). By looking at retrieval precision, 
one can tell if the retrieved information is directly addressing the user query. The system also looks at how the different retrieved contexts are ranked. If the most relevant context has the top rank, the metric reciprocal rank will be 1 el se it will be much lower. The ranking quality of 
the retrieved information can also be measured  by Normalized Discoun ted Cumulative Gain 
(NDCG) as a higher score on this metric, indicates the retrieved contexts are ranked in the correct order. 

66 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceThe content generation phase can be assessed not only by looking at the overall quality of the 
answers generated by the system, but also by analyzing the content watsonx.governance can tell how much of the context is used in the answers generated. By measuring how well the answer aligns with the context (faithfulness), or  by measuring if the answer is relevant to the 
prompt (answer relevance) or by looking at the number of questions that were unanswered by the model (unsuccessful requests), watsonx.governance gives the quality of the answers. The prominent content analysis metrics measure the percentage of keywords in the answer that are derived from the context (coverage) and the overall sequence of words in the answer are direct extractions from the context (density). 
In addition to the above metrics, along with th e faithfulness, watsonx.governance also gives 
out the top source attributions for the generated by answer by highlighting the relevant sentences in the context. This capability tries to o pen the black box, and is a step in the 
direction of providing explainability for the foundation model- generated answers. 
With a review of the common stages, we can now move onto implementation details for how 
to enable and complete lifecycle monitoring.
6.3  How to implement Lifecycle Governance
Lifecycle Governance begins at the use case level. In watsonx.governance, an AI use case is created and used to maintain a hierarchical organization of AI assets. This AI use case structure allows users to view their ML/AI assets  as they relate to the business problem of the 
use case. 
One use case can hold multiple assets with each asset being represented by a factsheet. 
These factsheets hold all details of a given asset. Consider an AI factsheet to be a sort of ânutrition labelâ to the underlyin g AI asset. This factsheet is w hat will be used to  represent the 
AI asset as it moves through each stage of its lifecycle.
The following sections will show us how to se t up AI use cases and how to create AI 
factsheets for AI assets.
6.3.1  Getting started: Setting up your AI use cases
After installation and adminis tration of watsonx.governance,  we can implement lifecycle 
governance beginning at the use case level. The purpose of lifecycle governance is monitoring the progress of AI assets individually. These AI assets progress through what is called an AI use case. These AI use cases are central to lifecycle monitoring because it allows us to group AI assets together which are working towards similar goals.
Before setting up lifecycle moni toring for the AI assets, we will set up our AI use case in 
watsonx.governance.
AI use case and AI  factsheet setup
Follow these steps to set up the AI use case in watsonx.govenance:
1. Use the Options menu from the watsonx home page  to access the AI use cases  page 
(under  AI governance â AI use cases ). See Figure 6-3 on page 67.

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 67Figure 6-3   AI use cases
2. Create a new inventory using the options menu from the AI use cases  page. 
Be sure to activate Governance Console integration  to ensure that your AI Inventory is 
synced with your Governance console. This synchronization effect persists throughout the work done in this chapter.
3. Once the new inventory is created, create an AI use case  and fill out all de tails for that AI 
use case. Any details posted to this AI use case  will also be reflected in the Governance 
Console. 
With an AI use case successfully  created, we will move  on to tracking the lifecycle of an AI 
asset for that AI use case. This  will be achieved by attaching AI  factsheets to the AI assets 
realizing and implementing the AI use case and using that AI factsheet to accomplish lifecycle governance. As mentioned 6.3, âHow to implement Lifecycle Governanceâ on page 66, an AI factsheet is the organizational representation of  an AI asset which gives us all asset details. 
The factsheet also gives us an effective vehicle for traversing between lifecycle stages.
Creating an AI factsheet for a given as set will be covered in de tail in subsequent 
sub-sections. Once the AI factsheet is crea ted, we can move on to lifecycle governance.
As described in 6.1, âWhat is the AI lifecycle?â on page 62, there are general activities in each 
lifecycle stage which should be completed before moving onto the next lifecycle stage. Using 
watsonx.governance, we can achieve full lifecycle monitoring for the AI asset. The following subsections will cover the basic steps for accomplishing lifecycl e governance using 
watsonx.governance.
The following subsections assume that the read er is experienced with LLM experimentation 
and that they are ready to begin governing and monitoring their AI solutions. Special considerations exist based on implementation det ails such as what platform the model is 
hosted on, and what is the use case. Thes e considerations will be  found under each 
appropriate subsection.
6.4  Lifecycle implementation and considerations
This section of the chapter will assume that there is a valid AI use case configured in 
watsonx.governance. It will also  make the assumption that a solution exists (either on 
watsonx.ai or another third party)  which realizes that AI use case. One final major assumption 
is the existence of ground-truth data. 


68 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceAs mentioned in the explanation of the validation stage, evaluations provide first-hand 
performance reviews to assets in a qualitative and quantitative way. To achieve this, ground-truth data is critical and must be acquired in order to effectively implement lifecycle governance.
The goal of this section is to explain the connection between the assets (prompt template 
assets or models) that realize the use case, which lifecycle stage those assets belong in, and how we automate the lifecycle of those assets as they  progress from devel opment through to 
operation.
Before diving into specific considerations, here are the higher-level activities which must be 
completed to effectively govern the lifecycle of an AI asset. A Prompt Template Asset or a Model must exist that contributes to the implementation of an established use case. A Prompt Template Asset (PTA) can be either a Prompt Te mplate from IBM's watsonx.ai, or a detached 
prompt template representing a prompt on a 3rd party platform. Similarly, a Model is simply any ML model which solves a traditional data  science / ML use case and can be either 
deployed in IBM watsonx.ai runtime or a 3rd party serving platform. With the asset ready, the steps are as follows:
/SM590000Track the solution in an AI use case to place in the development stage.
/SM590000Perform an evaluation to move the asset to the validation stage.
/SM590000Promote the asset to a production space to move the asset into the operation stage.
The above three steps are repeated in some variation based on platform and use case 
specifics. As a reminder, everyt hing accomplished in this chapter will be reflected across the 
Governance Console for administrative and business users to be automatically updated of 
progress.
6.4.1  UI-driven implementa tion of lifecycle governance
After installation and adm inistration, watsonx.ai s eamlessly integrates with 
watsonx.governance. Once an AI use case is established, users can run through a typical 
watsonx.ai workflow to begin experimenting with prompts in the prompt lab, or in a jupyter notebook environment. For instructions on how to perform this experimentation, refer to the watsonx.ai documentation  or the Redbooks publication: Simplify Your AI Journey: Unleashing 
the Power of AI with IBM watsonx.ai , SG24-8574.
Development
After saving your prompt lab experiment, from  the project home screen of watsonx.ai, view 
your assets tab. Find your saved prompt lab template, and using the hamburger menu of that prompt lab template, choose Track in AI use case . After following the gu ided click-through 
setup, your Prompt Template Asset (PTA) will be automatically placed under the development stage, tracked in the AI use case of your choice.
Validation
With a PTA being tracked against an AI use ca se in the development stage, users can utilize 
the power of watsonx.governance to perform fast and effective evaluations of their assets. To perform this step, validation data is required. Note:  This subsection covers a UI-driven implementation of lifecycle governance using 
watsonx.gov and watsonx.ai. For code-driven approaches, review 6.2.3, âModel healthâ on page 57 and 6.2.4, âG enerative AI qualityâ on page 57 . The watsonx.ai documentation will 
also be helpful.

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 69Work with use case SMEs and other teammates in order to build up a quality dataset of at 
least 10 records in CSV format which you can use to validate the performance of your PTA. Based on your use case, the fo rmat of your data will vary. Expl ore the evaluation page for 
your specific use case in order to identify the correct format for your validation data. For example, a summarization use case will have the following format for th e test data:
-Original_Text1, Ground_Truth_Summary1-
-Original_Text1, Ground_Truth_Summary2-
Once data is acquired, use the hamburger menu to ac cess the options of the given PTA. Click 
on Evaluate to open the evaluation page. Using the Actions drop-down, click on âEvaluate Nowâ and follow through the options on-screen to set up the evaluation experiment. To review the available evaluation metrics, check the latest documentation for your version of watsonx.governance.
After completing the evaluation, go back to your AI use case and scroll down. You should now 
see this asset as being tracked in the validation stage as a result of running the evaluation experiment. Before moving onto the operation stage, it is most common for assets to sit in the validation stage while iterations happen to improve performance. Evaluations can be constantly run against assets in the validation stage and the records of the latest evaluation can be viewed from the AI factsheet for that asset.
Operation
Once the validation stage is completed and the asset is ready to move into operation stage, head to your watsonx platform home page. Using the hamburger menu from the left, click on Deployments  to access the watsonx.ai runtime platform (traditionally known as Watson 
Machine Learning or WML), and create a new deployment space with âProductionâ type selected. Go back to the watsonx.ai project which holds the PTA, and using the options menu attached to the PTA, choose the Promote to Space  option. Follow the on-screen guidance to 
promote the PTA to the newly created production space.
Go to the home page of the deployment space on watsonx.ai runtimes. From the assets tab, 
the recently promoted PTA should be listed. Use the options menu attached to the PTA from this screen and choose the Deploy  option. Follow the guided scree n to fill out the relevant 
details, and click OK.
After a few moments, your new PTA will be deployed (and  consumable) on the production 
deployment space. You can now check again from your AI use case page to observe that the asset has moved from development, to validation, and finally into the operation stage. Congratulations, you have successfully performed a lif ecycle on this AI asset!Note:  There are multiple ways to access PT A evaluations. You could access this page 
through your AI Factsheet, on the second tab. You could also run evaluations directly from the Prompt lab. Feel free to explore the a ccessibility of this wats onx.governance feature.
Note:  Configuring monitors is an additional ta sk beyond the concept of simply moving 
through a lifecycle stage. This is specifically related to the operation stage of any AI asset; 
once the asset is in production (operation stage), the monitors for that deployment can be configured to track specific metrics. To achieve this through the UI for a watsonx.ai prompt, use the Actions  drop down menu on the top right section of the production deployment 
and choose Activate Monitors . Finally, follow the guided instru ctions to complete monitor 
configuration.

70 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceFrom this point on, considerat ions for each of th e following sub-sections will avoid repeating 
information and more ad vanced topics will be introduced throughout each se ction. At the 
highest level, all integrations of watsonx.governance with ML/AI providers work with the same 
concept of having an AI use ca se set up at watsonx.gover nance. The following sections will 
become more technical with various links to resources in the form of SDKs, notebooks, and code commands to help programmers accelerate implementation.
6.4.2  Considerations for lifecycle go vernance for traditional ML hosted on 
watsonx.ai
The same seamless integration applies for traditional ML when considering the watsonx.ai 
and watsonx.governance platforms. Assuming the initial ML model has been saved as an asset to the watsonx.ai project space, it can be associated to a use case through the UI in the same manner as explained in section 6.4.1. In addition to the UI-based approach, lifecycle governance can be implemented via code. 
This section will focus on useful APIs that can be used to achieve full lifecycle governance this 
as well as code examples. It will make an assumption of intermediate Python programming skills on behalf of the implementer.
API and SDK fo r watsonx.governance
This section assumes an API or Python-driven SDK approach to programming is being 
undertaken. Two main API and SDK can be used to work with watsonx.governance. Other APIs also exist which can help, and they w ill be mentioned as ne cessary throughout the 
chapter.
/SM590000AI Factsheets API and SDK - The watsonx.governance AI Factsheet API  and SDK is used 
to control the factsheets co mponent of watsonx. governance. It will be used to set up 
factsheet objects and associate them with given assets.
/SM590000OpenScale API and SDK - The watsonx.governance OpenScale API  and SDK controls 
the computational layer of watsonx.governance. The brunt of activity comes from this API. 
Users can accomplish a variet y of activities including:
â Creating subscriptions to monitor deployments.
â Performing model evaluations.â Associating existing factsheets to AI use cases.
Additionally, Governance Console APIs  are also available for interacting with Governance 
Console within watsonx.governance.
Metrics
The software comes out-of-box with a plethora of traditional metrics to monitor against. For more information, see Quality evaluations . Additionally, users can implement their own 
custom evaluation metrics.
For custom metrics implementation, users can use this sample notebook  from the 
IBM GitHub.Note:  This subsection will utilize code-drive n approaches. For more information, see 
Tracking a machine learning model .

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 71Inventory and AI use case setup
AI Inventories are used to hold AI use cases. These Inventories are agnostic to asset type - a 
generative AI use case can be held in the same inventory as a traditional ML/AI use case.
Inventory setup
This notebook from IBM's github showcases how to create an AI Inventory. This sample 
notebook  demonstrates a variety of functionality including:
/SM590000Open a new AI inventory
/SM590000Add collaborators
/SM590000Delete inventory
/SM590000Modify existing inventories
Because the AI Inventory concept is native to watsonx.governance, it is always implemented 
regardless of where the AI assets live which are being tracked.
AI use case setup
This notebook from the IBM GitHubshowcases how to create an AI use case. The sample 
notebook  demonstrates a variety of functionality including:
/SM590000Storing a model as an asset into watsonx.ai (this creates the AI factsheet)
/SM590000Create a new AI use case
/SM590000Associate the AI use case with a watsonx.ai project
/SM590000Track/Untrack a model under an AI use case
Development
In âInventory and AI use case setupâ on page 71, the linked notebook holds all relevant code 
for placing a model into the development stage of its lifecycle. Here it is again in condensed form.

ai_usecase = 
facts_client.assets.create_ai_usecase(catalog_id=ai_usecase_inventory_id,name=ai_usecase_name,description=ai_usecase_desc)
# track the model in the use casewatsonx_ai_model.track(usecase=ai_usecase,approach=decisiontree_approach,
version_number="major",version_comment="major update to previous version")Note:  The notebook linked above also covers how to code the configuration of quality 
monitors, fairness, drift, and explanations. It is highly recommended to consult sample 
notebooks for thorough and up-to-date instructions. For users who are looking to create data configurations to specific data science problems, see the IBM directory  for different 
options on creating data configurations.
Note: The following pseudo-code requires additional code to function properly. Users 
should consult the notebook and the API documentation linked in the previous sections for a full walkthrough.

72 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governanceValidation
Once the model is successfully tracked against an  AI use case, it is placed into development 
stage. If the model is already deployed into a production space,  it will instead show in the 
operation stage. This section will assume we have a model in the development stage of the 
lifecycle. 
There are multiple ways to move a model from the development stage into the validation 
stage. One way is to use the direct API call:
model.set_environment_type(from_container="develop", to_container="validate"). 
For more information, see Managing the Lifecycle Phases of a Model .
Additionally, you can deploy the model to a development deployment space or a validation 
deployment space and this will trigger the lifecycle move . For more information, see Tracking 
prompt templates .
This functionality applies to all kinds of implementation, not just traditional ML.Users can set the environment directly if the as set is in a preceding stage, or users can 
promote models to a validation space in watsonx.ai runtimes.
Operation
The operation stage is a uniquely important stage of the AI/ML lifecycle. Section 6.4.1, âUI-driven implementation of lifecycle governanceâ on page 68 covered basic steps to move an asset to the operation, but many more ac tivities can be accomplished for a thorough 
implementation of a production monitor. As mentioned in section 6.2, âMetrics in watsonx.governanceâ on page 64 and again in 6.4.2, âConsiderations for lifecycle governance for traditional ML hosted on watsonx.aiâ on page 70, a variety of metrics are available for configuration through watsonx.governance. When considering a model monitor in the operation stage, these metrics can be configured using the watsonx.governance UI or using notebooks. Review and follow the notebooks and directions provided in section 6.4.2, âConsiderations for lifecycle governance for tradi tional ML hosted on watsonx.aiâ on page 70 
to establish baseline data configurations and respective monitors.
Additionally, code commands also exist to directly move assets into the production (operation) 
stage. Here is a snippet on how to move a model into a production deployment space to see the lifecycle stage progre ss into operation stage:
model.set_environment_type(from_container="validate", to_container="production")
watsonx.governance comes with an expansive toolkit for handling the lifecycle of traditional 
ML/AI assets. Considerations for third parties do exist, but the tools that we have covered up to this point will be adapted to cove r those additional considerations.
6.4.3  Considerations for prompt  templates from another platform
IBM watsonx.governance empowers organization s to evaluate and monitor prompt templates 
for a variety of externally-hosted LLMs without the need to conduct inference on those models. This flexibility allows AI and Data Sc ience practitioners to work with models hosted 
on platforms such as Google Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, or AWS Bedrock, where all inference is performed remotely.
The platform offers a method known as the 
detached prompt template  for evaluating and 
monitoring prompt templates for externally-hosted LLMs without requiring model inference. 

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 73This approach involves programmatically creating a detached prompt template asset, which 
provides a high level of control. Evaluations are then conducted on the generated prompt output, with the results logged into watsonx.governance against the detached prompt template.
Additionally, one can evaluate a detached prompt template within a deployment space by 
creating a detached deployme nt. This setup offers severa l benefits and capabilities:
/SM590000Evaluating a prompt template within a project or space enhances the experience of 
reviewing evaluation results.
/SM590000One can utilize access control for projects and sp aces to invite collabo rators or restrict 
access as needed.
/SM590000The results of the evaluations can be tracked in factsheets related to AI use cases as part 
of the governance solution.
The sample code to create a detached prompt template is shown in Example 6-1.
Example 6-1   Sample code to create a detached prompt template
from ibm_aigov_facts_client import DetachedPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate
detached_information = DetachedPromptTemplate(
prompt_id=prompt_id,model_id=model_id,    model_provider=model_proivder,    model_name=model_name,    model_url=model_url,    prompt_url=prompt_url,    prompt_additional_info=prompt_additional_info)
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    input=input_text,    prompt_variables=prompt_variables,    input_prefix=input_prefix,    output_prefix=output_prefix,    model_parameters = model_parameter)
external_prompt_template_details = facts_client.assets.create_detached_prompt(
    name=prompt_name,    description=prompt_description,    model_id=model_id,    task_id=task_id,    prompt_details=prompt_template,    detached_information=detached_prompt_template)project_pta_id = external_prompt_template_details.to_dict()["asset_id"]
Once the detached prompt template is created, it follows the same lifecycle as described in 
6.4.2, âConsiderations for lifecycle governance for traditional ML hosted on watsonx.aiâ on page 70.Note:  The following pseudo-code requires additional code to function properly. For more 
information, see the notebook  and the API documentation .

74 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance6.4.4  Considerations for tradit ional ML from another platform
Just like prompt templates from other platforms, ML assets and deployments can exist 
outside of watsonx.governance  and still be monitored and tr acked by watsonx.governance. 
Lifecycle governance of third-party ML mo dels deployed on other platforms can be 
implemented through python code. IBM watsonx.governance provides all of the tools and methods necessary to achieve lifecycle governance regardless of where the asset exists. Section 6.4.2, âConsiderations for lifecycle governance for traditional ML hosted on watsonx.aiâ on page 70 introduces the tools which will be used to achieve these goals.
Many of the same steps apply when implementing lifecycle governance for ML assets 
deployed on other platforms. Review the setup steps covered in section 6.4.2, âConsiderations for lifecycle governance for tradi tional ML hosted on watsonx.aiâ on page 70 
to configure the AI Inventory and AI use case and review the introductions to the packages along with the data statistics configurations note books in that section. Once those activities 
are complete, new assets can be tracked against use cases in their appropriate lifecycle stages.
It is worth noting that many ML processes wh ich exist on other platforms are typically 
considered to be in a production state. Because of this, model tracking for third-party assets is most typically an administrative and organizati onal task while that asset is being developed 
and validated in its respective environment. Once the asset arrives into the production or operation stage, monitors can be configured for thorough and effective ML governance. For full instructions on how to configure headless subscriptions for ML models which are not hosted through watsonx.governance, see this notebook .
Batch processing can also be achieved with watsonx.governance. For step-by-step 
instructions on achieving batch processing, see this notebook , the documentation .
6.4.5  Governing AI embedde d in a business application
If an AI/ML asset which is consumed in a busine ss application is directly owned and operated 
by the governance team (or a department from the same organization as the governance team), any of the above techniques can be used to apply AI governance. Depending on the 
kind of AI/ML being used in the business application, a user may have to configure a detached prompt template for LLM (as described in section 6.4.3, âConsiderations for prompt templates from another platformâ on page 72) or they may have to configure a headless subscription for ML (as described in section 6.4.4, âConsiderations for traditional ML from another platformâ on page 74) If the ML/AI process is being provided by an outside vendor, various considerations should be made when look ing to apply governance to that process. 
This section will shed light on some of the mo st common and im portant things to consider 
when looking to govern an existing business  application where the AI/ML process is being 
provided through a vendor / service from outside the organization.
Consider accessibility
If the governance team  is not the direct owner of an AI process, the accessi bility of that AI 
process must be explored and evaluated. Contact the AI vendor and learn about the accessibility to the model. Can a headless subscription or a de tached prompt template be 
configured to create a live monitor of that model or process? If not, what are the alternatives that the vendor can provide? Do those alternatives meet your organization's requirements for AI/ML governance?

Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 75Considering requirements
Think about what the requirements are for governing the business application or process. Is 
live monitoring the only way to achieve those requirements? Can the requirements be achieved through some other means such as a report card of the AI process, or some other status update?
Ultimately, implementing end-to-end lifecycle monitoring of AI embedded in a business 
application is unique. Because of the fact that the AI already exists in a business application, some assumption may be made about the stage of that AI asset (it would be considered to be in production if it is live and being consumed by users.) This would make the process shorter than tracking a model from init ial development; A user may in itiate lifecycle governance on a 
business application's AI model beginning with the production or operation stage. 
Governing an AI/ML model from a business application must be accomplished with the same 
attention to detail regardless of who is the ve ndor / provider. As the process continues to 
evolve for AI governance, rules and requirements should be established with regarding which AI/ML providers and vend ors are to be sbe utilized by the organization. Befo re configuring 
lifecycle monitoring for those AI /ML processes, verify ing the vendor's ability to meet any legal 
requirements is an important starting point. Review Chapter 4, âOnboarding a new foundation modelâ on page 41 and Chapter 5, âAssessing a new use caseâ on page 53 for organizational processes and considerations to make prior to setting up lifecycle governance.
