### 4. Using the System

You have three ways to interact with your documents:

#### A. Streamlit GUI (Easiest)
```bash
./run_streamlit.sh
```
This opens a web-based graphical interface that lets you:
- Upload and manage PDFs with simple drag and drop
- Process documents with a single click
- Search through your documents
- View visualizations of your collections
- Monitor processing status and logs

The Streamlit interface is the most user-friendly way to use the system.

#### B. Simple Search (Fastest)
